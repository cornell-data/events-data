Rare and Manuscript Collections curators will offer tours between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/lincolns_unfinished_work_5289"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Lincoln%E2%80%99s%20Unfinished%20Work&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2017,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AOn%20January%2031,%201865%20the%20United%20States%20Congress%20passed%20the%2013th%20Amendment,%20ending%20slavery%20in%20America.%20President%20Lincoln%20would%20not%20live%20to%20see%20the%20final%20ratification%20of%20the%20Amendment.%20He%20was%20assassinated%20on%20April%2014%20and%20a%20shocked%20nation%20mourned%20his%20death.%20%0A%0ACornell%20University%20Library%20marks%20the%20150th%20anniversary%20of%20these%20historic%20events%20with%20an%20exhibition%20featuring%20Cornell%E2%80%99s%20manuscript%20of%20the%2013th%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution--one%20of%20only%2014%20copies%20signed%20by%20Lincoln--together%20with%20other%20rare%20documents%20and%20artifacts%20associated%20with%20Lincoln%E2%80%99s%20funeral.%0A%0AJoin%20us%20on%20September%2019th,%20Homecoming%20Weekend,%20for%20a%20special%20viewing%20of%20this%20exhibit%20and%20%E2%80%9C150%20Ways%20to%20Say%20Cornell%E2%80%9D%20in%20the%20Hirshland%20Gallery.%20Rare%20and%20Manuscript%20Collections%20curators%20will%20offer%20tours%20between%2010%20a.m.%20and%201%20p.m.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/lincolns_unfinished_work_5289%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 17 Sep 2015 09:00:00 -0400","Sep 17, 2015: Lincolns Unfinished Work at Kroch Library",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/lincolns_unfinished_work_5289","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1513880","-76.484535"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

This concern has been in the core in discussions of the current co-called crisis of the Humanities. In response to this pressing issue, many scholars have set in motion forms of involvement in community activism or social movements that are part of their scholarship and institutional practices.  In Latino/a and Latin Americanist circles, where activist scholarship has always been central to the intellectual mission, the recent US opening to this intellectual challenge has supported the beginning of a much more hemispheric conversation, including such urgent topics as questions of the USAs role in immigrant trajectories, rethinking academias relations to the voices of non-traditional native researchers from the Americas, and promoting emerging literary aesthetics and alignments.

In response to this pressing issue, many scholars have set in motion forms of involvement in community activism or social movements that are part of their scholarship and institutional practices.  In Latino/a and Latin Americanist circles, where activist scholarship has always been central to the intellectual mission, the recent US opening to this intellectual challenge has supported the beginning of a much more hemispheric conversation, including such urgent topics as questions of the USAs role in immigrant trajectories, rethinking academias relations to the voices of non-traditional native researchers from the Americas, and promoting emerging literary aesthetics and alignments. I will talk us through a bit of background history, and reference a few cases from my own research and practice, especially in relation to live performance in and about Latin America.

The Kepler Cluster Study (KeCS) was implemented as part of the Kepler mission to search for transiting exoplanets in open star clusters and to study the dependencies of stellar rotation on the most fundamental stellar properties - age and mass. In this talk I will motivate the two primary goals of KeCS, present our latest results, and discuss some of their implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems in star clusters, the angular momentum evolution of Sun-like stars, and for developing a new technique to determine stellar ages - gyrochronology.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/the_kepler_cluster_study_planets_and_gyrochronology"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20The%20Kepler%20Cluster%20Study:%20Planets%20and%20Gyrochronology%20&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2017,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AAbstract:%0A------------%0AThe%20precise%20time-domain%20observations%20from%20NASA's%20Kepler%20mission%20have%20lead%20to%20a%20breakthrough%20in%20the%20search%20for%20exoplanets%20in%20star%20clusters%20and%20have%20begun%20a%20new%20era%20in%20the%20study%20of%20stellar%20rotation.%20The%20Kepler%20Cluster%20Study%20(KeCS)%20was%20implemented%20as%20part%20of%20the%20Kepler%20mission%20to%20search%20for%20transiting%20exoplanets%20in%20open%20star%20clusters%20and%20to%20study%20the%20dependencies%20of%20stellar%20rotation%20on%20the%20most%20fundamental%20stellar%20properties%20-%20age%20and%20mass.%20In%20this%20talk%20I%20will%20motivate%20the%20two%20primary%20goals%20of%20KeCS,%20present%20our%20latest%20results,%20and%20discuss%20some%20of%20their%20implications%20for%20our%20understanding%20of%20the%20formation%20and%20evolution%20of%20planetary%20systems%20in%20star%20clusters,%20the%20angular%20momentum%20evolution%20of%20Sun-like%20stars,%20and%20for%20developing%20a%20new%20technique%20to%20determine%20stellar%20ages%20-%20gyrochronology.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/the_kepler_cluster_study_planets_and_gyrochronology%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 17 Sep 2015 16:00:00 -0400","Sep 17, 2015: The Kepler Cluster Study: Planets and Gyrochronology  at Space Sciences Building",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/the_kepler_cluster_study_planets_and_gyrochronology","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1553019","-76.48114"

Fenton, in his chambers in the old State Capitol in Albany, signed the bill that constitutes the charter of Cornell University. The ideals of the founders, Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, reflected in this Charter, were remarkable in their day and constituted a truly radical educational experiment for the 1860s. This exhibition provides a lively tour through Cornell's inspiring history. Highlights include the Cornell University Charter, the original telegraph receiver, the Cornell seal, building plans, Big Red sheet music, campus panoramas, and much more.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

In this talk I will explain recent work that attempts to bring in tools from algebraic geometry and polynomial optimization to some of the foundational problems in 3D computer vision with a particular focus on the most basic problem of reconstruction from two images.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/cam_colloquium_rekha_thomas_washington_"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20CAM%20Colloquium:%20Rekha%20Thomas%20(Washington)%20-%20Algebraic%20Vision%20&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2018,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AReconstructing%20a%20three-dimensional%20scene%20from%20two-dimensional%20images%20of%20it%20is%20a%20fundamental%20problem%20in%20computer%20vision.%20Real%20solutions%20to%20systems%20of%20polynomials%20play%20a%20key%20role%20in%20solving%20this%20problem.%20In%20this%20talk%20I%20will%20explain%20recent%20work%20that%20attempts%20to%20bring%20in%20tools%20from%20algebraic%20geometry%20and%20polynomial%20optimization%20to%20some%20of%20the%20foundational%20problems%20in%203D%20computer%20vision%20with%20a%20particular%20focus%20on%20the%20most%20basic%20problem%20of%20reconstruction%20from%20two%20images.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/cam_colloquium_rekha_thomas_washington_%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Fri, 18 Sep 2015 15:30:00 -0400","Sep 18, 2015: CAM Colloquium: Rekha Thomas (Washington) - Algebraic Vision  at Frank H.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2019,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Sat, 19 Sep 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Sep 19, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486239","-76.486069"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2020,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Sun, 20 Sep 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Sep 20, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486240","-76.486069"

Fenton, in his chambers in the old State Capitol in Albany, signed the bill that constitutes the charter of Cornell University. The ideals of the founders, Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, reflected in this Charter, were remarkable in their day and constituted a truly radical educational experiment for the 1860s. This exhibition provides a lively tour through Cornell's inspiring history. Highlights include the Cornell University Charter, the original telegraph receiver, the Cornell seal, building plans, Big Red sheet music, campus panoramas, and much more.

This could not be further from the truth.  Hysteria has a long and robust history in India, involving centuries of contact and multi-directional transmission of medical ideas, communications that foil the idea that medical ideas originate in ""the west"" and move outward.  Asking how hysteria has taken shape as a medical diagnosis, a gendered form of distress, and a cultural idea in India, this talk takes as its starting point the idea that hysteria did not come to India with the British, but rather grew up there in ways that bring to light persistent - and at times surprising - themes of consciousness, translation, and memory.</p><p> </p><p>Sarah Pinto is Associate Professor of Anthropology at Tufts University, and the author of Where There Is No Midwife: Birth and Loss in Rural India (Berghahn 2008) and Daughters of Parvati: Women and Madness in Contemporary India.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/hysteria_in_india_histories_of_consciousness_and_translation_by_sarah_pinto"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20%22Hysteria%20in%20India:%20Histories%20of%20Consciousness%20and%20Translation%22%20by%20Sarah%20Pinto&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2021,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ASarah%20Pinto%20--%20%20Hysteria%20-%20the%20medical%20diagnosis%20-%20has%20long%20been%20understood%20as%20a%20European%20diagnosis%20par%20excellence,%20with%20non-western%20appearances%20viewed%20as%20recent%20arrivals.%20%20This%20could%20not%20be%20further%20from%20the%20truth.%20%20Hysteria%20has%20a%20long%20and%20robust%20history%20in%20India,%20involving%20centuries%20of%20contact%20and%20multi-directional%20transmission%20of%20medical%20ideas,%20communications%20that%20foil%20the%20idea%20that%20medical%20ideas%20originate%20in%20%22the%20west%22%20and%20move%20outward.%20%20Asking%20how%20hysteria%20has%20taken%20shape%20as%20a%20medical%20diagnosis,%20a%20gendered%20form%20of%20distress,%20and%20a%20cultural%20idea%20in%20India,%20this%20talk%20takes%20as%20its%20starting%20point%20the%20idea%20that%20hysteria%20did%20not%20%E2%80%9Ccome%20to%E2%80%9D%20India%20with%20the%20British,%20but%20rather%20grew%20up%20there%20in%20ways%20that%20bring%20to%20light%20persistent%20-%20and%20at%20times%20surprising%20-%20themes%20of%20consciousness,%20translation,%20and%20memory.%0A%0A%20%0A%0ASarah%20Pinto%20is%20Associate%20Professor%20of%20Anthropology%20at%20Tufts%20University,%20and%20the%20author%20of%20Where%20There%20Is%20No%20Midwife:%20Birth%20and%20Loss%20in%20Rural%20India%20(Berghahn%202008)%20and%20Daughters%20of%20Parvati:%20Women%20and%20Madness%20in%20Contemporary%20India.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/hysteria_in_india_histories_of_consciousness_and_translation_by_sarah_pinto%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Mon, 21 Sep 2015 12:15:00 -0400","Sep 21, 2015: ""Hysteria in India: Histories of Consciousness and Translation"" by Sarah Pinto at Uris Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/hysteria_in_india_histories_of_consciousness_and_translation_by_sarah_pinto","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1450575","-76.480274"

The ideals of the founders, Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, reflected in this Charter, were remarkable in their day and constituted a truly radical educational experiment for the 1860s. This exhibition provides a lively tour through Cornell's inspiring history.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2022,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Tue, 22 Sep 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Sep 22, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486241","-76.486069"

Professor Eun-Ah Kim, host.</p><p>Seminar Title:  Tensor network renormalization</p><p>Abstract:  The renormalization group (RG), one of the conceptual pillars of statistical mechanics and quantum field theory, explores how the behavior of an extended system depends on the scale of observation. Important notions such as universality, criticality or stability of phases are explained in terms of the existence of fixed-points of the RG flow. On the other hand, studies of entanglement in the context of quantum information have resulted in the development of tensor networks, a framework to efficiently describe many-body wave-functions. I will review a decade-long research program based on applying tensor networks to the renormalization group. This program has produced a novel non-perturbative, real-space RG approach and the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), currently of interest in a wide range of research areas, from statistical mechanics to condensed matter and quantum field theory, from holography in quantum gravity, to error correction in classical and quantum information theory.</p><p>Poster available.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/lassp_and_aep_seminar_3558"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20LASSP%20and%20A&EP%20SEMINAR&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2022,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AGuifre%20Vidal,%20Department%20of%20Physics,%20Perimeter%20Institute%20For%20Theoretical%20Physics,%20will%20present%20seminar.%20Professor%20Eun-Ah%20Kim,%20host.%0A%0ASeminar%20Title:%20%20Tensor%20network%20renormalization%0A%0AAbstract:%20%20The%20renormalization%20group%20(RG),%20one%20of%20the%20conceptual%20pillars%20of%20statistical%20mechanics%20and%20quantum%20field%20theory,%20explores%20how%20the%20behavior%20of%20an%20extended%20system%20depends%20on%20the%20scale%20of%20observation.%20Important%20notions%20such%20as%20universality,%20criticality%20or%20stability%20of%20phases%20are%20explained%20in%20terms%20of%20the%20existence%20of%20fixed-points%20of%20the%20RG%20flow.%20On%20the%20other%20hand,%20studies%20of%20entanglement%20in%20the%20context%20of%20quantum%20information%20have%20resulted%20in%20the%20development%20of%20tensor%20networks,%20a%20framework%20to%20efficiently%20describe%20many-body%20wave-functions.%20I%20will%20review%20a%20decade-long%20research%20program%20based%20on%20applying%20tensor%20networks%20to%20the%20renormalization%20group.%20This%20program%20has%20produced%20a%20novel%20non-perturbative,%20real-space%20RG%20approach%20and%20the%20multi-scale%20entanglement%20renormalization%20ansatz%20(MERA),%20currently%20of%20interest%20in%20a%20wide%20range%20of%20research%20areas,%20from%20statistical%20mechanics%20to%20condensed%20matter%20and%20quantum%20field%20theory,%20from%20holography%20in%20quantum%20gravity,%20to%20error%20correction%20in%20classical%20and%20quantum%20information%20theory.%0A%0APoster%20available.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/lassp_and_aep_seminar_3558%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Tue, 22 Sep 2015 16:00:00 -0400","Sep 22, 2015: LASSP and A&EP SEMINAR at Clark Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/lassp_and_aep_seminar_3558","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1381587","-76.481209"

Fenton, in his chambers in the old State Capitol in Albany, signed the bill that constitutes the charter of Cornell University. The ideals of the founders, Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, reflected in this Charter, were remarkable in their day and constituted a truly radical educational experiment for the 1860s. This exhibition provides a lively tour through Cornell's inspiring history. Highlights include the Cornell University Charter, the original telegraph receiver, the Cornell seal, building plans, Big Red sheet music, campus panoramas, and much more.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2023,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Wed, 23 Sep 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Sep 23, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486242","-76.486069"

"2015-09-23T19:15:00-04:00","42.446495","<p>1978 > USA > Directed by Charles Burnett With Henry Sanders, Kaycee Moore, Angela Burnett A classic masterpiece of independent African American cinema and one of the first 50 films to be added to the National Film Registry, Charles Burnett's virtuosic drama was made for $10,000 while in film school at UCLA. Burnett served as the film's writer, director, editor, producer and cameraman. Shot in LA's Watts neighborhood in the mid-1970s, the meditative film follows a few random incidents in the life of the introspective, depressed Stan, a slaughterhouse worker with insomnia. The film is notable not for its characters or its milieu (though both are striking) but its outstanding sensitivity and inspired pacing, framing, and imagery.

Fenton, in his chambers in the old State Capitol in Albany, signed the bill that constitutes the charter of Cornell University. The ideals of the founders, Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, reflected in this Charter, were remarkable in their day and constituted a truly radical educational experiment for the 1860s. This exhibition provides a lively tour through Cornell's inspiring history. Highlights include the Cornell University Charter, the original telegraph receiver, the Cornell seal, building plans, Big Red sheet music, campus panoramas, and much more.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

Its syncretistic mixture has always been dynamic, renewed and revised through spirit sances, and often mixed with nationalist aspirations.  After 1975, many Caodai leaders went into exile, establishing congregations in Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties.  The initial vision of bringing the gods of the East and West together has been adjusted to new historical contexts and political challenges.  Contrasts between the founding generation in French Indochina and descendants and disciples in California are explored by assessing the relationship between syncretism and diaspora, and the construction and dissolution of religious borders.</p><p>Bio: </p><p>Janet Hoskins is Professor of Anthropology and Religion at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles.

We are using cell-specific transcriptomics, functional genomics and ionomics to understand how plants take up, distribute and accumulate trace elements within plant tissues, including seeds. We have identified 70+ Arabidopsis transporters preferentially expressed in phloem-loading cells, most of them with unknown function. We have cloned these transporters in yeast expression vectors and assembled a functional expression library for high throughput screening of substrates using different yeast backgrounds. Initial screens have identified transporters that induce hypersensitivity to cadmium or arsenic. Growth-based assays using yeast deficient in iron uptake suggest some transporters may mobilize Fe into yeast.</p><p> </p><p>We are also characterizing plants carrying T-DNA insertions in phloem transporters. Using a recently described mutant (opt3-2) that over accumulates Cd in seeds2, we have identified a transporter that suppresses the Cd sensitivity and over-accumulation of cadmium in opt3-2. Radiotracer imaging suggests that this transporter regulates Cd uptake for long-distance transport. Understanding the mechanisms that mediate trace metal accumulation in plants will help developing crops with higher nutritional value and minimal accumulation of non-essential elements such as cadmium and arsenic in edible tissues.</p><p>1.

Food prices have fluctuated dramatically over the last decade, especially for commodities such as rice, wheat, and maize.  Despite the importance of agriculture in many developing countries economies, few understand the processes that led to policy responses or the relative power and behavior of stakeholders. Understanding why governments responded as they did to these food price fluctuations is important for shaping new strategies to confront future price volatility in the market.</p><p>Join us for a Chats in the Stacks talk with Graduate School Professor Per Pinstrup-Andersen, editor of the new book Food Price Policy in an Era of Market Instability: A Political Economy Analysis, published by Oxford University Press in January of 2015.  His book presents the political economy studies of food price policy in 14 developing countries as well as the United States and the European Union.

The Exo-S final report was released in early 2015, and it includes two options: (1) a<br />standalone mission using a modest aperture (1.1-m) space telescope launched together with a 30-m starshade, and (2) a 34-m starshade launched independently to rendezvous with an existing larger space telescope (in this case we specifically consider WFIRST/AFTA).  Both options can image nearby<br />exo-Earths, sub-Neptunes, and previously known and newly discovered Jupiters.  Both missions can characterize the atmospheres of giant planets with low-resolution spectroscopy, while the larger mission can also characterize exo-Earths and mini-Neptunes.  We also explored the full range<br />of planet sizes and temperatures that might be accessible to such a mission, for each of the nearest stellar systems.  For the coming year, the Exo-S team has set its sight on WFIRST, and an enhanced mission scenario where the telescope ends up at L2 instead of geosynchonous orbit  and what it could do with a starshade.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/exploring_exoplanets_with_a_starshade_mission"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Exploring%20Exoplanets%20with%20a%20Starshade%20Mission%20&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2024,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0A%22Exo-S%22%20is%20NASA's%20first%20community-directed%20study%20of%20a%20starshade%20(or%20%E2%80%9Cexternal%20occulter%E2%80%9D)%20plus%20telescope%20system%20for%20a%20space-based%20direct%20imaging%20mission%20to%20discover%20and%20spectrally%20characterize%20exoplanets.%20The%20Exo-S%20final%20report%20was%20released%20in%20early%202015,%20and%20it%20includes%20two%20options:%20(1)%20a%0Astandalone%20mission%20using%20a%20modest%20aperture%20(1.1-m)%20space%20telescope%20launched%20together%20with%20a%2030-m%20starshade,%20and%20(2)%20a%2034-m%20starshade%20launched%20independently%20to%20rendezvous%20with%20an%20existing%20larger%20space%20telescope%20(in%20this%20case%20we%20specifically%20consider%20WFIRST/AFTA).%20%20Both%20options%20can%20image%20nearby%0Aexo-Earths,%20sub-Neptunes,%20and%20previously%20known%20and%20newly%20discovered%20Jupiters.%20%20Both%20missions%20can%20characterize%20the%20atmospheres%20of%20giant%20planets%20with%20low-resolution%20spectroscopy,%20while%20the%20larger%20mission%20can%20also%20characterize%20exo-Earths%20and%20mini-Neptunes.%20%20We%20also%20explored%20the%20full%20range%0Aof%20planet%20sizes%20and%20temperatures%20that%20might%20be%20accessible%20to%20such%20a%20mission,%20for%20each%20of%20the%20nearest%20stellar%20systems.%20%20For%20the%20coming%20year,%20the%20Exo-S%20team%20has%20set%20its%20sight%20on%20WFIRST,%20and%20an%20enhanced%20mission%20scenario%20where%20the%20telescope%20ends%20up%20at%20L2%20instead%20of%20geosynchonous%20orbit%20%E2%80%94%20and%20what%20it%20could%20do%20with%20a%20starshade.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/exploring_exoplanets_with_a_starshade_mission%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 24 Sep 2015 16:00:00 -0400","Sep 24, 2015: Exploring Exoplanets with a Starshade Mission  at Space Sciences Building",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/exploring_exoplanets_with_a_starshade_mission","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1507560","-76.48114"

Fenton, in his chambers in the old State Capitol in Albany, signed the bill that constitutes the charter of Cornell University. The ideals of the founders, Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, reflected in this Charter, were remarkable in their day and constituted a truly radical educational experiment for the 1860s. This exhibition provides a lively tour through Cornell's inspiring history. Highlights include the Cornell University Charter, the original telegraph receiver, the Cornell seal, building plans, Big Red sheet music, campus panoramas, and much more.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

Due to lack of suitable solution methods, these problems are traditionally approximated as a single-criterion problem and solved.

Food systems and healthy community plans prepared in her graduate planning classes have won numerous local and national awards, including the Best Studio Award from the American Institute of Certified Planners.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>As calls to strengthen communities food systems continue to grow, local governments have begun to respond by deploying a host of planning and policy tools. Some are preparing comprehensive food systems plans; others are offering tax incentives to foster community food businesses. This is, some would argue, a heady time for food systems planning. Yet this turn warrants great caution and clarity about the purpose and means by which public policy is used to intervene in the food system. Overregulation and underinvestment  the current mode of local government intervention in the food system  is unlikely to address its problems. This presentation draws on a decade-long qualitative study of Buffalo, New York and reviews trends nationally to illustrate the possibilities and pitfalls of using local government planning to strengthen food systems. It highlights the important, if challenging, role of community engagement in developing and implementing food policies and plans.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/samina_raja_over_regulation_and_underinvestment_local_governing_planning_response_to_problems_in_the_food_system"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Samina%20Raja:%20Over%20Regulation%20and%20Underinvestment:%20Local%20Governing%20Planning%20Response%20to%20Problems%20in%20the%20Food%20System&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2025,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ADr.%20Samina%20Raja%20is%20an%20associate%20professor%20of%20urban%20and%20regional%20planning%20and%20the%20principal%20investigator%20of%20the%20Food%20Systems%20Planning%20and%20Healthy%20Communities%20Lab%20at%20the%20University%20at%20Buffalo,%20State%20University%20of%20New%20York.%20Her%20teaching%20and%20research%20focus%20on%20the%20role%20of%20planning%20and%20policy%20in%20building%20healthy%20communities%20and%20sustainable%20food%20systems.%20She%20currently%20directs%20Growing%20Food%20Connections,%20a%20five-year%20federally%20funded%20research%20grant%20focused%20on%20building%20capacity%20of%20local%20governments%20to%20connect%20small-and%20medium%20sized%20farmers%20with%20low-income%20consumers.%0A%0ARaja%20is%20a%20recipient%20of%20Western%20New%20York%E2%80%99s%2040%20Under%20Forty%20Award%20given%20for%20professional%20success%20and%20commitment%20to%20the%20community%20and%20the%202014%20Dale%20Scholar%20Prize%20for%20excellence%20in%20urban%20and%20regional%20planning%20scholarship.%20Food%20systems%20and%20healthy%20community%20plans%20prepared%20in%20her%20graduate%20planning%20classes%20have%20won%20numerous%20local%20and%20national%20awards,%20including%20the%20Best%20Studio%20Award%20from%20the%20American%20Institute%20of%20Certified%20Planners.%0A%0AAbstract:%0A%0AAs%20calls%20to%20strengthen%20communities%E2%80%99%20food%20systems%20continue%20to%20grow,%20local%20governments%20have%20begun%20to%20respond%20by%20deploying%20a%20host%20of%20planning%20and%20policy%20tools.%20Some%20are%20preparing%20comprehensive%20food%20systems%20plans;%20others%20are%20offering%20tax%20incentives%20to%20foster%20community%20food%20businesses.%20This%20is,%20some%20would%20argue,%20a%20heady%20time%20for%20food%20systems%20planning.%20Yet%20this%20turn%20warrants%20great%20caution%20and%20clarity%20about%20the%20purpose%20and%20means%20by%20which%20public%20policy%20is%20used%20to%20intervene%20in%20the%20food%20system.%20Overregulation%20and%20underinvestment%20%E2%80%94%20the%20current%20mode%20of%20local%20government%20intervention%20in%20the%20food%20system%20%E2%80%94%20is%20unlikely%20to%20address%20its%20problems.%20This%20presentation%20draws%20on%20a%20decade-long%20qualitative%20study%20of%20Buffalo,%20New%20York%20and%20reviews%20trends%20nationally%20to%20illustrate%20the%20possibilities%20and%20pitfalls%20of%20using%20local%20government%20planning%20to%20strengthen%20food%20systems.%20It%20highlights%20the%20important,%20if%20challenging,%20role%20of%20community%20engagement%20in%20developing%20and%20implementing%20food%20policies%20and%20plans.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/samina_raja_over_regulation_and_underinvestment_local_governing_planning_response_to_problems_in_the_food_system%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Fri, 25 Sep 2015 12:20:00 -0400","Sep 25, 2015: Samina Raja: Over Regulation and Underinvestment: Local Governing Planning Response to Problems in the Food System at McGraw Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/samina_raja_over_regulation_and_underinvestment_local_governing_planning_response_to_problems_in_the_food_system","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1474516","-76.485428"

"2015-09-25T15:30:00-04:00","42.443451","<p>Stable Lvy motions are now used in many areas of science and engineering to model anomalous super-diffusion, where a plume of particles spreads faster than the traditional Brownian motion model predicts. Their probability densities solve a partial differential equation that involves fractional derivatives. When the process is reflected to stay in the positive the real line, it becomes a Markov process. In this talk, we explicitly compute the transition densities of this Markov process, and their governing equation. This Kolmogorov forward equation involves a fractional boundary condition to enforce the no-flux boundary. This seems to be the first known derivation of a fractional reflecting boundary condition. We then apply numerical methods to explicitly compute the transition density of this space-inhomogeneous Markov process, for any starting point, to any desired degree of accuracy. Finally, we discuss an application to fractional Cauchy problems, which involve a positive Caputo fractional derivative in time.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/cam_colloquium_mark_meerschaert_michigan_state"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20CAM%20Colloquium:%20%20Mark%20Meerschaert%20(Michigan%20State)%20-%20Reflected%20stable%20L%C3%A9vy%20motions%20and%20their%20governing%20equations&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2025,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AStable%20L%C3%A9vy%20motions%20are%20now%20used%20in%20many%20areas%20of%20science%20and%20engineering%20to%20model%20anomalous%20super-diffusion,%20where%20a%20plume%20of%20particles%20spreads%20faster%20than%20the%20traditional%20Brownian%20motion%20model%20predicts.%20Their%20probability%20densities%20solve%20a%20partial%20differential%20equation%20that%20involves%20fractional%20derivatives.%20When%20the%20process%20is%20reflected%20to%20stay%20in%20the%20positive%20the%20real%20line,%20it%20becomes%20a%20Markov%20process.%20In%20this%20talk,%20we%20explicitly%20compute%20the%20transition%20densities%20of%20this%20Markov%20process,%20and%20their%20governing%20equation.%20This%20Kolmogorov%20forward%20equation%20involves%20a%20fractional%20boundary%20condition%20to%20enforce%20the%20no-flux%20boundary.%20This%20seems%20to%20be%20the%20first%20known%20derivation%20of%20a%20fractional%20reflecting%20boundary%20condition.%20We%20then%20apply%20numerical%20methods%20to%20explicitly%20compute%20the%20transition%20density%20of%20this%20space-inhomogeneous%20Markov%20process,%20for%20any%20starting%20point,%20to%20any%20desired%20degree%20of%20accuracy.%20Finally,%20we%20discuss%20an%20application%20to%20fractional%20Cauchy%20problems,%20which%20involve%20a%20positive%20Caputo%20fractional%20derivative%20in%20time.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/cam_colloquium_mark_meerschaert_michigan_state%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Fri, 25 Sep 2015 15:30:00 -0400","Sep 25, 2015: CAM Colloquium:  Mark Meerschaert (Michigan State) - Reflected stable Lvy motions and their governing equations at Frank H.

This had led to a very feature-centric approach to concepts (i.e., a lime is green, round, and tart; a carrot is orange, tubular, and sweet). In recent years my group has begun to attempt to put concepts back together,"" specifically, by focusing on the integration of features into concepts and the integration of simple concepts into complex concepts.  </p><p>In this seminar, I will present some new fMRI research demonstrating our approach to understanding conceptual integration. To begin, I will illustrate how we can measure both segregation and integration of two visual features (shape and color) and I will briefly comment on the role of feature diagnosticity in their integration.  Next, I will report a new finding regarding integration of an abstract feature (value) with a visual feature (shape). I will also discuss our recent foray into the study of conceptual combination, and some preliminary evidence for the functional specialization of two anatomically distinct conceptual hubs. If time allows, I will also touch on related work concerning fast-mapping of new concepts and metaphor comprehension, both of which draw on our ideas about conceptual integration.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/the_cognitive_science_program_the_department_of_psychology_present_8472"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20The%20Cognitive%20Science%20Program%20&%20the%20Department%20of%20Psychology%20present&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2025,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ASharon%20Thompson-%C2%ADSchill,%20PhD%0A%0ACenter%20for%20Cognitive%20Neuroscience,%20University%20of%20Pennsylvania%0A%0AConceptual%20Integration%0A%0AFor%20the%20past%20two%20decades,%20I%20(and%20many%20of%20my%20colleagues%20in%20the%20fields%20of%20cognitive%20psychology,%20neuropsychology,%20and%20neuroscience)%20have%20been%20trying%20to%20understand%20the%20cognitive%20and%20neural%20structure%20of%20long-term%20memory%20for%20concepts%20by%20%E2%80%9Ctaking%20the%20concepts%20apart.%22%20This%20had%20led%20to%20a%20very%20feature-centric%20approach%20to%20concepts%20(i.e.,%20a%20lime%20is%20green,%20round,%20and%20tart;%20a%20carrot%20is%20orange,%20tubular,%20and%20sweet).%20In%20recent%20years%20my%20group%20has%20begun%20to%20attempt%20to%20%E2%80%9Cput%20concepts%20back%20together,%22%20specifically,%20by%20focusing%20on%20the%20integration%20of%20features%20into%20concepts%20and%20the%20integration%20of%20simple%20concepts%20into%20complex%20concepts.%20%20%0A%0AIn%20this%20seminar,%20I%20will%20present%20some%20new%20fMRI%20research%20demonstrating%20our%20approach%20to%20understanding%20conceptual%20integration.%20To%20begin,%20I%20will%20illustrate%20how%20we%20can%20measure%20both%20segregation%20and%20integration%20of%20two%20visual%20features%20(shape%20and%20color)%20and%20I%20will%20briefly%20comment%20on%20the%20role%20of%20feature%20diagnosticity%20in%20their%20integration.%20%20Next,%20I%20will%20report%20a%20new%20finding%20regarding%20integration%20of%20an%20abstract%20feature%20(value)%20with%20a%20visual%20feature%20(shape).%20I%20will%20also%20discuss%20our%20recent%20foray%20into%20the%20study%20of%20conceptual%20combination,%20and%20some%20preliminary%20evidence%20for%20the%20functional%20specialization%20of%20two%20anatomically%20distinct%20conceptual%20hubs.%20If%20time%20allows,%20I%20will%20also%20touch%20on%20related%20work%20concerning%20fast-mapping%20of%20new%20concepts%20and%20metaphor%20comprehension,%20both%20of%20which%20draw%20on%20our%20ideas%20about%20conceptual%20integration.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/the_cognitive_science_program_the_department_of_psychology_present_8472%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Fri, 25 Sep 2015 15:30:00 -0400","Sep 25, 2015: The Cognitive Science Program & the Department of Psychology present at 202 Uris Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/the_cognitive_science_program_the_department_of_psychology_present_8472","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1501647",None

In her new book, Lone Pursuit: Distrust and Defensive Individualism among the Black Poor (Russell Sage Foundation), Smith advances current and enduring debates about black joblessness, highlighting the role of interpersonal distrust dynamics between low-income black jobholders and their jobseeking relations that make cooperation during the process of finding work a problematic affair. In her current project, tentatively titled Why Blacks Help Less, Smith further interrogates the process of finding work by examining racial and ethnic differences in trust dynamics and exploring the social psychological, cultural, and structural factors that generate these differences. In addition to Lone Pursuit, Smith has published a number of articles in such journals as the American Journal of Sociology, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences, the Annual Review of Sociology, Racial and Ethnic Studies, Social Science Research, and The Sociological Quarterly.</p><p><a href=""http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/sandra-susan-smith"">http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/sandra-susan-smith</a></p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/want_need_fit_the_cultural_logics_underlying_job_contacts_assistance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Want,%20Need,%20Fit:%20The%20Cultural%20Logics%20Underlying%20Job%20Contacts'%20Assistance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2025,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AVisiting%20Speaker,%20Sandra%20Susan%20Smith,%20is%20an%20Associate%20Professor%20of%20Sociology%20at%20the%20University%20of%20California-Berkeley.%20%0A%0ACo-Sponsored%20by%20Africana%20Studies%20and%20Research%20Center%0A%0ASmith's%20research%20interests%20include%20urban%20poverty,%20joblessness,%20race%20and%20ethnicity,%20social%20networks%20and%20social%20capital,%20trust,%20and%20culture%20and%20social%20structure.%20%20In%20her%20new%20book,%20Lone%20Pursuit:%20Distrust%20and%20Defensive%20Individualism%20among%20the%20Black%20Poor%20(Russell%20Sage%20Foundation),%20Smith%20advances%20current%20and%20enduring%20debates%20about%20black%20joblessness,%20highlighting%20the%20role%20of%20interpersonal%20distrust%20dynamics%20between%20low-income%20black%20jobholders%20and%20their%20jobseeking%20relations%20that%20make%20cooperation%20during%20the%20process%20of%20finding%20work%20a%20problematic%20affair.%20In%20her%20current%20project,%20tentatively%20titled%20Why%20Blacks%20Help%20Less,%20Smith%20further%20interrogates%20the%20process%20of%20finding%20work%20by%20examining%20racial%20and%20ethnic%20differences%20in%20trust%20dynamics%20and%20exploring%20the%20social%20psychological,%20cultural,%20and%20structural%20factors%20that%20generate%20these%20differences.%20In%20addition%20to%20Lone%20Pursuit,%20Smith%20has%20published%20a%20number%20of%20articles%20in%20such%20journals%20as%20the%20American%20Journal%20of%20Sociology,%20The%20Annals%20of%20the%20American%20Academy%20of%20Political%20and%20Social%20Sciences,%20the%20Annual%20Review%20of%20Sociology,%20Racial%20and%20Ethnic%20Studies,%20Social%20Science%20Research,%20and%20The%20Sociological%20Quarterly.%0A%0Ahttp://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/sandra-susan-smith%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/want_need_fit_the_cultural_logics_underlying_job_contacts_assistance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Fri, 25 Sep 2015 15:30:00 -0400","Sep 25, 2015: Want, Need, Fit: The Cultural Logics Underlying Job Contacts' Assistance at Uris Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/want_need_fit_the_cultural_logics_underlying_job_contacts_assistance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1496270","-76.482254"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2026,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Sat, 26 Sep 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Sep 26, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486245","-76.486069"

She's a delightful singer and performer, and very welcome back to Bound for Glory.   <a href=""http://www.kyleannecarey.com"">www.kyleannecarey.com</a></p><p>SEPT. 6 MAD GOAT STRING BAND.

It'll be their first Bound for Glory show.  Hope you'll come.</p><p>SEPT. 13     JOHN KIRK AND TRISH MILLER.  It's been a very long time since John and Trish were on the show.

Bob White was quite well known and quite influential at the end of the Great Folk Scare, but he disappeared from view for a few decades.

We're very pleased to have him back on the show.</p><p>SEPT. 27        LOUISE MOSRIE.  She comes from Nashville, but her flavor is all her own.  Louise Mosrie is a most excellent singer and songwriter, who will make you feel good at the same time that she makes you think.

"2015-09-27T10:00:00-04:00","42.450729","<p>Taiwanese artist Huang Hsin-chiens installation combines everyday objects with real-time video and virtual stereoscopic computer-generated animation to explore memory, dreams, and what lies beneath the surface of consciousness. In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2027,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Sun, 27 Sep 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Sep 27, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486246","-76.486069"

Fenton, in his chambers in the old State Capitol in Albany, signed the bill that constitutes the charter of Cornell University. The ideals of the founders, Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, reflected in this Charter, were remarkable in their day and constituted a truly radical educational experiment for the 1860s. This exhibition provides a lively tour through Cornell's inspiring history. Highlights include the Cornell University Charter, the original telegraph receiver, the Cornell seal, building plans, Big Red sheet music, campus panoramas, and much more.

The ideals of the founders, Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, reflected in this Charter, were remarkable in their day and constituted a truly radical educational experiment for the 1860s. This exhibition provides a lively tour through Cornell's inspiring history. Highlights include the Cornell University Charter, the original telegraph receiver, the Cornell seal, building plans, Big Red sheet music, campus panoramas, and much more.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2029,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Tue, 29 Sep 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Sep 29, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486247","-76.486069"

"2015-09-29T16:15:00-04:00","42.443451","<p>We study a system that consists of multiple servers, where one has the option to (instantaneously) turn off servers and turn them on (after some delay). Such systems arise in the study of computer server farms where one is interested in simultaneously addressing response times and energy costs. For systems with one queue per server, we show that it may be advantageous for the servers to be heterogeneous in their server control policies. For a system with one queue for the entire system and where the underlying random variables are exponential, we give several structural results for the optimal server control policy. These structural results are then leveraged to yield a tractable means to solve the underlying CTMC. The solution is then used to address a typical design issue: determining the number of servers that should be permanently on. Finally, some open issues and challenges will be discussed.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/orie_colloquium_douglas_down_mcmaster_"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20ORIE%20Colloquium:%20Douglas%20Down%20(McMaster)%20-%20Control%20of%20on/off%20queueing%20systems%20with%20multiple%20servers&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2029,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AWe%20study%20a%20system%20that%20consists%20of%20multiple%20servers,%20where%20one%20has%20the%20option%20to%20(instantaneously)%20turn%20off%20servers%20and%20turn%20them%20on%20(after%20some%20delay).%20Such%20systems%20arise%20in%20the%20study%20of%20computer%20server%20farms%20where%20one%20is%20interested%20in%20simultaneously%20addressing%20response%20times%20and%20energy%20costs.%20For%20systems%20with%20one%20queue%20per%20server,%20we%20show%20that%20it%20may%20be%20advantageous%20for%20the%20servers%20to%20be%20heterogeneous%20in%20their%20server%20control%20policies.%20For%20a%20system%20with%20one%20queue%20for%20the%20entire%20system%20and%20where%20the%20underlying%20random%20variables%20are%20exponential,%20we%20give%20several%20structural%20results%20for%20the%20optimal%20server%20control%20policy.%20These%20structural%20results%20are%20then%20leveraged%20to%20yield%20a%20tractable%20means%20to%20solve%20the%20underlying%20CTMC.%20The%20solution%20is%20then%20used%20to%20address%20a%20typical%20design%20issue:%20determining%20the%20number%20of%20servers%20that%20should%20be%20permanently%20on.%20Finally,%20some%20open%20issues%20and%20challenges%20will%20be%20discussed.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/orie_colloquium_douglas_down_mcmaster_%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Tue, 29 Sep 2015 16:15:00 -0400","Sep 29, 2015: ORIE Colloquium: Douglas Down (McMaster) - Control of on/off queueing systems with multiple servers at Frank H.

Winey</p><p>Professor and TowerBrook Foundation Faculty Fellow of Materials Science and Engineering and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering<br />University of Pennsylvania</p><p>Precise Acid- and Ion-Containing Copolymers: New Morphologies and New Insights about Mechanical Properties </p><p>Acid- and ion-containing polymers have specific interactions that produce complex and hierarchical morphologies that impart remarkable ranges of tunable properties.  Renewed interest in these materials arises from various applications including as single-ion conductors in battery applications, selective membranes for water treatment, and self-healing materials.  Most of these polymers are copolymers and often random copolymers wherein the separation between the functional groups on the polymers is non-uniform and individual copolymers have distinct compositions.  This inherent structural diversity confounds the longstanding efforts to establish robust structure-property relationships.  In contrast, precise acid copolymers and their ionomers are synthesized by acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) from macromonomers, such that the functional groups are evenly spaced along linear polyethylene.  These unique model materials provide molecular precision that imparts unprecedented morphological uniformity and control and we have identified numerous new morphologies.  Our primary experimental tool is X-ray scattering to probe the nano-scale morphology a room temperature, elevated temperature and during mechanical deformation.  At elevated temperatures, we find outstanding agreement with course grain and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that provide new insights about acid and ionic aggregation in these materials.  In particular, the experiments and simulations suggest the presence of highly branched, stringy aggregates that can be percolated structures at high acid or ion content.  The relationships between the chemical structures of precise copolymers, their hierarchical aggregate structures and the effect on mechanical properties have been explored using in situ tensile testing with X-ray scattering.  When the acid groups are separated by 15 carbons, the precise copolymer exhibits a structural transformation from a nominally spherical to a layered aggregate morphology during tensile deformation that coincides with substantial strain hardening. This structural transformation is particularly sensitive to the strain rate, because the relaxation times of the polyethylene segments and the acid aggregates are accessible. Commensurate with this structural transformation, this particular polymer has the highest tensile strength of the precise poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) copolymers.                     </p><p><a href=""http://winey.seas.upenn.edu/"">http://winey.seas.upenn.edu/</a></p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/cbe_seminar_karen_winey"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20CBE%20Seminar:%20Karen%20Winey:%20Precise%20Acid-%20and%20Ion-Containing%20Copolymers:%C2%A0New%20Morphologies%20and%20New%20Insights%20about%20Mechanical%20Properties&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2030,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AKaren%20I.%20Winey%0A%0AProfessor%20and%20TowerBrook%20Foundation%20Faculty%20Fellow%20of%20Materials%20Science%20and%20Engineering%20and%20Chemical%20and%20Biomolecular%20Engineering%0AUniversity%20of%20Pennsylvania%0A%0APrecise%20Acid-%20and%20Ion-Containing%20Copolymers:%20New%20Morphologies%20and%20New%20Insights%20about%20Mechanical%20Properties%20%0A%0AAcid-%20and%20ion-containing%20polymers%20have%20specific%20interactions%20that%20produce%20complex%20and%20hierarchical%20morphologies%20that%20impart%20remarkable%20ranges%20of%20tunable%20properties.%20%20Renewed%20interest%20in%20these%20materials%20arises%20from%20various%20applications%20including%20as%20single-ion%20conductors%20in%20battery%20applications,%20selective%20membranes%20for%20water%20treatment,%20and%20self-healing%20materials.%20%20Most%20of%20these%20polymers%20are%20copolymers%20and%20often%20random%20copolymers%20wherein%20the%20separation%20between%20the%20functional%20groups%20on%20the%20polymers%20is%20non-uniform%20and%20individual%20copolymers%20have%20distinct%20compositions.%20%20This%20inherent%20structural%20diversity%20confounds%20the%20longstanding%20efforts%20to%20establish%20robust%20structure-property%20relationships.%20%20In%20contrast,%20precise%20acid%20copolymers%20and%20their%20ionomers%20are%20synthesized%20by%20acyclic%20diene%20metathesis%20(ADMET)%20from%20macromonomers,%20such%20that%20the%20functional%20groups%20are%20evenly%20spaced%20along%20linear%20polyethylene.%20%20These%20unique%20model%20materials%20provide%20molecular%20precision%20that%20imparts%20unprecedented%20morphological%20uniformity%20and%20control%20and%20we%20have%20identified%20numerous%20new%20morphologies.%20%20Our%20primary%20experimental%20tool%20is%20X-ray%20scattering%20to%20probe%20the%20nano-scale%20morphology%20a%20room%20temperature,%20elevated%20temperature%20and%20during%20mechanical%20deformation.%20%20At%20elevated%20temperatures,%20we%20find%20outstanding%20agreement%20with%20course%20grain%20and%20atomistic%20molecular%20dynamics%20simulations%20that%20provide%20new%20insights%20about%20acid%20and%20ionic%20aggregation%20in%20these%20materials.%20%20In%20particular,%20the%20experiments%20and%20simulations%20suggest%20the%20presence%20of%20highly%20branched,%20stringy%20aggregates%20that%20can%20be%20percolated%20structures%20at%20high%20acid%20or%20ion%20content.%20%20The%20relationships%20between%20the%20chemical%20structures%20of%20precise%20copolymers,%20their%20hierarchical%20aggregate%20structures%20and%20the%20effect%20on%20mechanical%20properties%20have%20been%20explored%20using%20in%20situ%20tensile%20testing%20with%20X-ray%20scattering.%20%20When%20the%20acid%20groups%20are%20separated%20by%2015%20carbons,%20the%20precise%20copolymer%20exhibits%20a%20structural%20transformation%20from%20a%20nominally%20spherical%20to%20a%20layered%20aggregate%20morphology%20during%20tensile%20deformation%20that%20coincides%20with%20substantial%20strain%20hardening.%20This%20structural%20transformation%20is%20particularly%20sensitive%20to%20the%20strain%20rate,%20because%20the%20relaxation%20times%20of%20the%20polyethylene%20segments%20and%20the%20acid%20aggregates%20are%20accessible.%20Commensurate%20with%20this%20structural%20transformation,%20this%20particular%20polymer%20has%20the%20highest%20tensile%20strength%20of%20the%20precise%20poly(ethylene-co-acrylic%20acid)%20copolymers.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%0A%0Ahttp://winey.seas.upenn.edu/%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/cbe_seminar_karen_winey%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Wed, 30 Sep 2015 09:00:00 -0400","Sep 30, 2015: CBE Seminar: Karen Winey: Precise Acid- and Ion-Containing Copolymers:New Morphologies and New Insights about Mechanical Properties at Olin Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/cbe_seminar_karen_winey","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1429088",None

When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Sep%2030,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Wed, 30 Sep 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Sep 30, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486248","-76.486069"

The department brought together a group of faculty and students who not only produced a remarkable body of films and videos but went on to invigorate the American media scene for the next half-century. Scott MacDonald will be here in person to discuss Binghamton's avant-garde history and screen the seminal experimental works The Act of Seeing with Ones Own Eyes (Brakhage), Barn Rushes (Gottheim), and Serene Velocity (Gehr).

This year, the critically important topic of how to attract and retain the next generation of organic dairy producers will be tackled. With the average age of a US farmer creeping up to the late 50s, its time to figure out how to adapt the farm to the changing needs of our children and grandchildren if we hope to keep organic dairy alive in the United States. We are hearing a lot from this next generation, with some saying that they just cant farm 24/7 as their parents and grandparents have done, and are seeking new ways of getting the work done, and others are saying that the lifestyle of organic farming is very important to their young families. They want to be able to support themselves without having to rely on off-farm income, and they want to utilize new technology to make their farms operate efficiently, less labor-intensively, AND allowing for regular time off. The NODPA Field Days program will explore the current obstacles and opportunities for the next generation of organic dairy farmers, and will present success stories where family farms are adopting new and creative practices for the 21st century, and will hear from young farmers who will inform the discussion.</p><p>The next generation wont be the only topic on the program; participants will hear from a diverse group of national and regional leaders and educators who will share with producers and service providers their knowledge, ideas and business experiences that are relevant to the important topics facing organic dairy farm families, today. Participants will get an update on the grass-fed milk trend; have an extended, on-farm workshop on cow comfort; and will hear about robotic milking in the Netherlands, where it all began. Liana Hoodes, the founding director of the National Organic Coalition will be NODPA Field Days keynote speaker. She will share her experiences and observations about the future of the Organic brand, and following her presentation, everyone will have a chance to jump into the conversation during a discussion facilitated by Fay Benson, that we are calling Working Together for a Sustainable Organic Dairy Future.</p><p>This year, Field Days will wrap up with a special event. The New York Organic Dairy Initiative will host a cookout at the nearby Letchworth State Park, often called The Grand Canyon of the East, to conclude this years NODPA meeting. Its a beautiful time of year to view the magnificent falls of the Genesee River.</p><p>Register and pay online here.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/the_15th_annual_nodpa_field_days"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20The%2015th%20Annual%20NODPA%20Field%20Days&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%201,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AWestern%20New%20York%20will%20play%20host%20to%20the%2015th%20Annual%20NODPA%20Field%20Days%20on%20October%201st%20and%202nd,%20in%20Pavilion%20NY,%20an%20active%20farming%20community%20south%20of%20Rochester,%20NY.%20This%20year,%20the%20critically%20important%20topic%20of%20how%20to%20attract%20and%20retain%20the%20next%20generation%20of%20organic%20dairy%20producers%20will%20be%20tackled.%20With%20the%20average%20age%20of%20a%20US%20farmer%20creeping%20up%20to%20the%20late%2050%E2%80%99s,%20it%E2%80%99s%20time%20to%20figure%20out%20how%20to%20adapt%20the%20farm%20to%20the%20changing%20needs%20of%20our%20children%20and%20grandchildren%20if%20we%20hope%20to%20keep%20organic%20dairy%20alive%20in%20the%20United%20States.%20We%20are%20hearing%20a%20lot%20from%20this%20next%20generation,%20with%20some%20saying%20that%20they%20just%20can%E2%80%99t%20farm%2024/7%20as%20their%20parents%20and%20grandparents%20have%20done,%20and%20are%20seeking%20new%20ways%20of%20getting%20the%20work%20done,%20and%20others%20are%20saying%20that%20the%20lifestyle%20of%20organic%20farming%20is%20very%20important%20to%20their%20young%20families.%20They%20want%20to%20be%20able%20to%20support%20themselves%20without%20having%20to%20rely%20on%20off-farm%20income,%20and%20they%20want%20to%20utilize%20new%20technology%20to%20make%20their%20farms%20operate%20efficiently,%20less%20labor-intensively,%20AND%20allowing%20for%20regular%20time%20off.%20The%20NODPA%20Field%20Days%20program%20will%20explore%20the%20current%20obstacles%20and%20opportunities%20for%20the%20next%20generation%20of%20organic%20dairy%20farmers,%20and%20will%20present%20success%20stories%20where%20family%20farms%20are%20adopting%20new%20and%20creative%20practices%20for%20the%2021st%20century,%20and%20will%20hear%20from%20young%20farmers%20who%20will%20inform%20the%20discussion.%0A%0AThe%20next%20generation%20won%E2%80%99t%20be%20the%20only%20topic%20on%20the%20program;%20participants%20will%20hear%20from%20a%20diverse%20group%20of%20national%20and%20regional%20leaders%20and%20educators%20who%20will%20share%20with%20producers%20and%20service%20providers%20their%20knowledge,%20ideas%20and%20business%20experiences%20that%20are%20relevant%20to%20the%20important%20topics%20facing%20organic%20dairy%20farm%20families,%20today.%20Participants%20will%20get%20an%20update%20on%20the%20grass-fed%20milk%20trend;%20have%20an%20extended,%20on-farm%20workshop%20on%20cow%20comfort;%20and%20will%20hear%20about%20robotic%20milking%20in%20the%20Netherlands,%20where%20it%20all%20began.%20Liana%20Hoodes,%20the%20founding%20director%20of%20the%20National%20Organic%20Coalition%20will%20be%20NODPA%20Field%20Days%E2%80%99%20keynote%20speaker.%20She%20will%20share%20her%20experiences%20and%20observations%20about%20the%20future%20of%20the%20Organic%20brand,%20and%20following%20her%20presentation,%20everyone%20will%20have%20a%20chance%20to%20jump%20into%20the%20conversation%20during%20a%20discussion%20facilitated%20by%20Fay%20Benson,%20that%20we%20are%20calling%20Working%20Together%20for%20a%20Sustainable%20Organic%20Dairy%20Future.%0A%0AThis%20year,%20Field%20Days%20will%20wrap%20up%20with%20a%20special%20event.%20The%20New%20York%20Organic%20Dairy%20Initiative%20will%20host%20a%20cookout%20at%20the%20nearby%20Letchworth%20State%20Park,%20often%20called%20The%20Grand%20Canyon%20of%20the%20East,%20to%20conclude%20this%20year%E2%80%99s%20NODPA%20meeting.%20It%E2%80%99s%20a%20beautiful%20time%20of%20year%20to%20view%20the%20magnificent%20falls%20of%20the%20Genesee%20River.%0A%0ARegister%20and%20pay%20online%20here.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/the_15th_annual_nodpa_field_days%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 01 Oct 2015 08:30:00 -0400","Oct 1, 2015: The 15th Annual NODPA Field Days at BWs Restaurant and Banquet Facility",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/the_15th_annual_nodpa_field_days","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1538223","-78.022883"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%201,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 01 Oct 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Oct 1, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486249","-76.486069"

Fifty years after they were perpetrated, much of what is known about them hinges on anecdotal accounts that are, of necessity, local and limited in their scope. While authors including Cribb, Hughes, Kammen, MacGregor, May, Robinson, and Roosa have enriched the literature with their detailed accounts of the events, to date, there has not been an analysis that systematically compares the experiences of every district in the worst-affected provinces.</p><p>This project entails a detailed examination of statistics that inform our knowledge of the Indonesian killings of 1965-66. Using data previously not analyzed by scholars of the subject, evidence is presented on the severity of the killings across the three provinces and two special districts of Java and the provinces of Bali and North Sumatra, the subject of Oppenheimers now-famous film, The Act of Killing. The analysis identifies hot spots for the killings which, while broadly aligned with earlier accounts on the subject, yields some interesting new details of where the killings likely occurred and how intense they were in terms of numbers of victims.</p><p>After these patterns are established, the literature on the causes of the killings is examined with a focus on the role of the PKI, politico-religious parties in Indonesia, and the Indonesian Army.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/seap_gatty_lecture_series_2330"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20SEAP%20Gatty%20Lecture%20Series&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%201,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0A%22New%20Findings%20on%20the%20Indonesian%20Killings%20of%201965-66%22%0A%0ASiddharth%20Chandra,%20Professor%20and%20Director,%20Asian%20Studies%20Center,%20Michigan%20State%20University%0A%0AIn%20terms%20of%20sheer%20scale,%20the%20Indonesian%20killings%20of%201965-66%20comprise%20the%20single%20most%20traumatic%20event%20in%20independent%20Indonesia.%20Fifty%20years%20after%20they%20were%20perpetrated,%20much%20of%20what%20is%20known%20about%20them%20hinges%20on%20anecdotal%20accounts%20that%20are,%20of%20necessity,%20local%20and%20limited%20in%20their%20scope.%20While%20authors%20including%20Cribb,%20Hughes,%20Kammen,%20MacGregor,%20May,%20Robinson,%20and%20Roosa%20have%20enriched%20the%20literature%20with%20their%20detailed%20accounts%20of%20the%20events,%20to%20date,%20there%20has%20not%20been%20an%20analysis%20that%20systematically%20compares%20the%20experiences%20of%20every%20district%20in%20the%20worst-affected%20provinces.%0A%0AThis%20project%20entails%20a%20detailed%20examination%20of%20statistics%20that%20inform%20our%20knowledge%20of%20the%20Indonesian%20killings%20of%201965-66.%20Using%20data%20previously%20not%20analyzed%20by%20scholars%20of%20the%20subject,%20evidence%20is%20presented%20on%20the%20severity%20of%20the%20killings%20across%20the%20three%20provinces%20and%20two%20special%20districts%20of%20Java%20and%20the%20provinces%20of%20Bali%20and%20North%20Sumatra,%20the%20subject%20of%20Oppenheimer%E2%80%99s%20now-famous%20film,%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Act%20of%20Killing.%E2%80%9D%20The%20analysis%20identifies%20hot%20spots%20for%20the%20killings%20which,%20while%20broadly%20aligned%20with%20earlier%20accounts%20on%20the%20subject,%20yields%20some%20interesting%20new%20details%20of%20where%20the%20killings%20likely%20occurred%20and%20how%20intense%20they%20were%20in%20terms%20of%20numbers%20of%20victims.%0A%0AAfter%20these%20patterns%20are%20established,%20the%20literature%20on%20the%20causes%20of%20the%20killings%20is%20examined%20with%20a%20focus%20on%20the%20role%20of%20the%20PKI,%20politico-religious%20parties%20in%20Indonesia,%20and%20the%20Indonesian%20Army.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/seap_gatty_lecture_series_2330%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 01 Oct 2015 12:00:00 -0400","Oct 1, 2015: SEAP Gatty Lecture Series at Kahin Center",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/seap_gatty_lecture_series_2330","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1513842","-76.491318"

"2015-10-01T16:00:00-04:00","42.448891","<p>I will discuss the results of three major programs of studying star formation, cold gas, feedback and dynamics of massive 'normal' star forming galaxies near the peak of the epoch of galaxy formation (z~1-3). Our observations were carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer and with large instruments developed with significant or leading MPE participation (the VLT near-IR integral field spectrometers SINFONI and KMOS, and the far-IR spectrometer/photometer PACS on Herschel). When combined, those studies clearly show that massive star forming galaxies near the star formation-stellar mass 'main-sequence' were gas rich, highly turbulent and clumpy, disky systems with varying  rotational support. Star formation in these galaxies was plausibly driven by continuous, rapid accretion of gas and minor mergers from the cosmic web. The evolution of their disks and central bulges was probably strongly influenced by disk fragmentation and instabilities, as well as by powerful galactic outflows driven from the large star forming clumps and AGN. I will discuss the impact of these new observations on our understanding of galaxy evolution in the early Universe.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/the_formation_and_evolution_of_massive_star_forming_disks_9094"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20The%20Formation%20and%20Evolution%20of%20Massive%20Star%20Forming%20Disks%20&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%201,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AI%20will%20discuss%20the%20results%20of%20three%20major%20programs%20of%20studying%20star%20formation,%20cold%20gas,%20feedback%20and%20dynamics%20of%20massive%20'normal'%20star%20forming%20galaxies%20near%20the%20peak%20of%20the%20epoch%20of%20galaxy%20formation%20(z~1-3).%20Our%20observations%20were%20carried%20out%20with%20the%20IRAM%20Plateau%20de%20Bure%20interferometer%20and%20with%20large%20instruments%20developed%20with%20significant%20or%20leading%20MPE%20participation%20(the%20VLT%20near-IR%20integral%20field%20spectrometers%20SINFONI%20and%20KMOS,%20and%20the%20far-IR%20spectrometer/photometer%20PACS%20on%20Herschel).%20When%20combined,%20those%20studies%20clearly%20show%20that%20massive%20star%20forming%20galaxies%20near%20the%20star%20formation-stellar%20mass%20'main-sequence'%20were%20gas%20rich,%20highly%20turbulent%20and%20clumpy,%20disky%20systems%20with%20varying%20%20rotational%20support.%20Star%20formation%20in%20these%20galaxies%20was%20plausibly%20driven%20by%20continuous,%20rapid%20accretion%20of%20gas%20and%20minor%20mergers%20from%20the%20cosmic%20web.%20The%20evolution%20of%20their%20disks%20and%20central%20bulges%20was%20probably%20strongly%20influenced%20by%20disk%20fragmentation%20and%20instabilities,%20as%20well%20as%20by%20powerful%20galactic%20outflows%20driven%20from%20the%20large%20star%20forming%20clumps%20and%20AGN.%20I%20will%20discuss%20the%20impact%20of%20these%20new%20observations%20on%20our%20understanding%20of%20galaxy%20evolution%20in%20the%20early%20Universe.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/the_formation_and_evolution_of_massive_star_forming_disks_9094%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 01 Oct 2015 16:00:00 -0400","Oct 1, 2015: The Formation and Evolution of Massive Star Forming Disks  at Space Sciences Building",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/the_formation_and_evolution_of_massive_star_forming_disks_9094","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1500392","-76.48114"

This year, the critically important topic of how to attract and retain the next generation of organic dairy producers will be tackled. With the average age of a US farmer creeping up to the late 50s, its time to figure out how to adapt the farm to the changing needs of our children and grandchildren if we hope to keep organic dairy alive in the United States. We are hearing a lot from this next generation, with some saying that they just cant farm 24/7 as their parents and grandparents have done, and are seeking new ways of getting the work done, and others are saying that the lifestyle of organic farming is very important to their young families. They want to be able to support themselves without having to rely on off-farm income, and they want to utilize new technology to make their farms operate efficiently, less labor-intensively, AND allowing for regular time off. The NODPA Field Days program will explore the current obstacles and opportunities for the next generation of organic dairy farmers, and will present success stories where family farms are adopting new and creative practices for the 21st century, and will hear from young farmers who will inform the discussion.</p><p>The next generation wont be the only topic on the program; participants will hear from a diverse group of national and regional leaders and educators who will share with producers and service providers their knowledge, ideas and business experiences that are relevant to the important topics facing organic dairy farm families, today. Participants will get an update on the grass-fed milk trend; have an extended, on-farm workshop on cow comfort; and will hear about robotic milking in the Netherlands, where it all began. Liana Hoodes, the founding director of the National Organic Coalition will be NODPA Field Days keynote speaker. She will share her experiences and observations about the future of the Organic brand, and following her presentation, everyone will have a chance to jump into the conversation during a discussion facilitated by Fay Benson, that we are calling Working Together for a Sustainable Organic Dairy Future.</p><p>This year, Field Days will wrap up with a special event. The New York Organic Dairy Initiative will host a cookout at the nearby Letchworth State Park, often called The Grand Canyon of the East, to conclude this years NODPA meeting. Its a beautiful time of year to view the magnificent falls of the Genesee River.</p><p>Register and pay online here.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/the_15th_annual_nodpa_field_days"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20The%2015th%20Annual%20NODPA%20Field%20Days&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%202,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AWestern%20New%20York%20will%20play%20host%20to%20the%2015th%20Annual%20NODPA%20Field%20Days%20on%20October%201st%20and%202nd,%20in%20Pavilion%20NY,%20an%20active%20farming%20community%20south%20of%20Rochester,%20NY.%20This%20year,%20the%20critically%20important%20topic%20of%20how%20to%20attract%20and%20retain%20the%20next%20generation%20of%20organic%20dairy%20producers%20will%20be%20tackled.%20With%20the%20average%20age%20of%20a%20US%20farmer%20creeping%20up%20to%20the%20late%2050%E2%80%99s,%20it%E2%80%99s%20time%20to%20figure%20out%20how%20to%20adapt%20the%20farm%20to%20the%20changing%20needs%20of%20our%20children%20and%20grandchildren%20if%20we%20hope%20to%20keep%20organic%20dairy%20alive%20in%20the%20United%20States.%20We%20are%20hearing%20a%20lot%20from%20this%20next%20generation,%20with%20some%20saying%20that%20they%20just%20can%E2%80%99t%20farm%2024/7%20as%20their%20parents%20and%20grandparents%20have%20done,%20and%20are%20seeking%20new%20ways%20of%20getting%20the%20work%20done,%20and%20others%20are%20saying%20that%20the%20lifestyle%20of%20organic%20farming%20is%20very%20important%20to%20their%20young%20families.%20They%20want%20to%20be%20able%20to%20support%20themselves%20without%20having%20to%20rely%20on%20off-farm%20income,%20and%20they%20want%20to%20utilize%20new%20technology%20to%20make%20their%20farms%20operate%20efficiently,%20less%20labor-intensively,%20AND%20allowing%20for%20regular%20time%20off.%20The%20NODPA%20Field%20Days%20program%20will%20explore%20the%20current%20obstacles%20and%20opportunities%20for%20the%20next%20generation%20of%20organic%20dairy%20farmers,%20and%20will%20present%20success%20stories%20where%20family%20farms%20are%20adopting%20new%20and%20creative%20practices%20for%20the%2021st%20century,%20and%20will%20hear%20from%20young%20farmers%20who%20will%20inform%20the%20discussion.%0A%0AThe%20next%20generation%20won%E2%80%99t%20be%20the%20only%20topic%20on%20the%20program;%20participants%20will%20hear%20from%20a%20diverse%20group%20of%20national%20and%20regional%20leaders%20and%20educators%20who%20will%20share%20with%20producers%20and%20service%20providers%20their%20knowledge,%20ideas%20and%20business%20experiences%20that%20are%20relevant%20to%20the%20important%20topics%20facing%20organic%20dairy%20farm%20families,%20today.%20Participants%20will%20get%20an%20update%20on%20the%20grass-fed%20milk%20trend;%20have%20an%20extended,%20on-farm%20workshop%20on%20cow%20comfort;%20and%20will%20hear%20about%20robotic%20milking%20in%20the%20Netherlands,%20where%20it%20all%20began.%20Liana%20Hoodes,%20the%20founding%20director%20of%20the%20National%20Organic%20Coalition%20will%20be%20NODPA%20Field%20Days%E2%80%99%20keynote%20speaker.%20She%20will%20share%20her%20experiences%20and%20observations%20about%20the%20future%20of%20the%20Organic%20brand,%20and%20following%20her%20presentation,%20everyone%20will%20have%20a%20chance%20to%20jump%20into%20the%20conversation%20during%20a%20discussion%20facilitated%20by%20Fay%20Benson,%20that%20we%20are%20calling%20Working%20Together%20for%20a%20Sustainable%20Organic%20Dairy%20Future.%0A%0AThis%20year,%20Field%20Days%20will%20wrap%20up%20with%20a%20special%20event.%20The%20New%20York%20Organic%20Dairy%20Initiative%20will%20host%20a%20cookout%20at%20the%20nearby%20Letchworth%20State%20Park,%20often%20called%20The%20Grand%20Canyon%20of%20the%20East,%20to%20conclude%20this%20year%E2%80%99s%20NODPA%20meeting.%20It%E2%80%99s%20a%20beautiful%20time%20of%20year%20to%20view%20the%20magnificent%20falls%20of%20the%20Genesee%20River.%0A%0ARegister%20and%20pay%20online%20here.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/the_15th_annual_nodpa_field_days%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Fri, 02 Oct 2015 06:30:00 -0400","Oct 2, 2015: The 15th Annual NODPA Field Days at BWs Restaurant and Banquet Facility",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/the_15th_annual_nodpa_field_days","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1538224","-78.022883"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

"2015-10-02T12:15:00-04:00","42.443451","<p>While much effort is being put into building special-purpose wireless sensor networks (WSN) for environmental monitoring, the use of existing measurements from a commercial wireless communication system is suggested as an opportunistic sensor network for environmental monitoring. In particular, we propose using measurements of the received signal level (RSL) in the backhaul communication microwave network (CMN) of cellular systems. Recent results have demonstrated the use of the suggested technique for estimating and mapping of rain, as well as of monitoring other-than-rain phenomena, such as: snow and sleet, moisture, for and dew. However, existing measurements of the RSL in a commercial communication microwave network go through non-linear preprocessing, matched to the needs of the cellular providers. Typically, the signals are roughly quantized, and in most protocols the min/max RSL values over each period of 15 minutes is stored, instead of instantaneous samples of the RSL. I will discuss the challenges in adopting statistical signal processing tools to deal with such limitations for optimally detecting precipitation, estimating the accumulated rainfall, and constructing instantaneous rain maps by parameter estimation of the rain fields. </p><p>Biography:<br />Hagit Messer, Fellow of the IEEE, has joined the faculty of Engineering at Tel Aviv University (TAU) in 1986, after post-doctorate at Yale University, where she is a professor of Electrical Engineering.

"2015-10-02T15:30:00-04:00","42.443451","<p>If during a physical experiment one parameter is slightly varied one expects in general no dramatic change but that the observed stationary physical states vary continuously with the parameter in a unique way. This is precisely what the Implicit Function Theorem predicts in a corresponding mathematical model. However, in some cases something unexpected happens if the parameter exceeds a critical threshold. Physicists call it a self-organization of a new state, a spontaneous symmetry breaking, an onset of auto-oscillations and so on. Mathematically spoken a bifurcation takes place, either a bifurcation of equilibria or of periodic solutions, the latter also called a Hopf Bifurcation. (Of course more complex solutions may emerge in some cases, too.) The new state is actually observed if there is an exchange of stability, which means that the ground state loses and the bifurcating state gains stability. Many striking examples of these phenomena can be observed in reality.</p><p>In this talk we give an overview of important bifurcation theorems for equilibria and explain these by examples and counterexamples. Finally, we discuss a specific example given by the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Cahn-Hilliard energy of a binary alloy.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/cam_colloquium_hansjorg_kielhofer_augsburg_"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20CAM%20Colloquium:%20%20Hansj%C3%B6rg%20Kielh%C3%B6fer%20(Augsburg)%20-%20%20Some%20Aspects%20of%20Bifurcation%20Theory&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%202,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AIf%20during%20a%20physical%20experiment%20one%20parameter%20is%20slightly%20varied%20one%20expects%20in%20general%20no%20dramatic%20change%20but%20that%20the%20observed%20stationary%20physical%20states%20vary%20continuously%20with%20the%20parameter%20in%20a%20unique%20way.%20This%20is%20precisely%20what%20the%20Implicit%20Function%20Theorem%20predicts%20in%20a%20corresponding%20mathematical%20model.%20However,%20in%20some%20cases%20something%20unexpected%20happens%20if%20the%20parameter%20exceeds%20a%20critical%20threshold.%20Physicists%20call%20it%20a%20%E2%80%9Cself-organization%20of%20a%20new%20state%E2%80%9D,%20a%20%E2%80%9Cspontaneous%20symmetry%20breaking%E2%80%9D,%20an%20%E2%80%9Conset%20of%20auto-oscillations%E2%80%9D%20and%20so%20on.%20Mathematically%20spoken%20a%20bifurcation%20takes%20place,%20either%20a%20bifurcation%20of%20equilibria%20or%20of%20periodic%20solutions,%20the%20latter%20also%20called%20a%20Hopf%20Bifurcation.%20(Of%20course%20more%20complex%20solutions%20may%20emerge%20in%20some%20cases,%20too.)%20The%20new%20state%20is%20actually%20observed%20if%20there%20is%20an%20exchange%20of%20stability,%20which%20means%20that%20the%20ground%20state%20loses%20and%20the%20bifurcating%20state%20gains%20stability.%20Many%20striking%20examples%20of%20these%20phenomena%20can%20be%20observed%20in%20reality.%0A%0AIn%20this%20talk%20we%20give%20an%20overview%20of%20important%20bifurcation%20theorems%20for%20equilibria%20and%20explain%20these%20by%20examples%20and%20counterexamples.%20Finally,%20we%20discuss%20a%20specific%20example%20given%20by%20the%20Euler-Lagrange%20equation%20for%20the%20Cahn-Hilliard%20energy%20of%20a%20binary%20alloy.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/cam_colloquium_hansjorg_kielhofer_augsburg_%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Fri, 02 Oct 2015 15:30:00 -0400","Oct 2, 2015: CAM Colloquium:  Hansjrg Kielhfer (Augsburg) -  Some Aspects of Bifurcation Theory at Frank H.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%203,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Sat, 03 Oct 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Oct 3, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486251","-76.486069"

It'll be their first Bound for Glory show.  Hope you'll come.</p><p>SEPT. 13     JOHN KIRK AND TRISH MILLER.  It's been a very long time since John and Trish were on the show.  Fiddle, banjo, clogging on the radio.  Super singing.  Both traditional and contemporary songs and tunes, sure to leave you with a smile.  <a href=""http://www.johnandtrish.com"">www.johnandtrish.com</a>.</p><p>SEPT. 20        BOB WHITE AND FRIENDS.  Bob White was quite well known and quite influential at the end of the Great Folk Scare, but he disappeared from view for a few decades.  He's resurfaced, and, with a bunch of friends, is performing traditionally flavored American folk, with strength and flair.  We're very pleased to have him back on the show.</p><p>SEPT. 27        LOUISE MOSRIE.  She comes from Nashville, but her flavor is all her own.  Louise Mosrie is a most excellent singer and songwriter, who will make you feel good at the same time that she makes you think.  Please join us for the second Louise Mosrie Bound for Glory show.  <a href=""http://www.louisemosrie.com"">www.louisemosrie.com</a></p><p>OCT. 4        RICHIE AND ROSIE.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

The NSF requires a data management plan with all grant applications (including dissertation improvement grants!), but data management is just as important for the individual researcher trying to document and organize files, track scientific output, and perform quality control. Many of these skills are learned by trial and error, or passed on by peers.

A brief introduction is given of x-ray absorption spectroscopy, including the multiplet interpretation of XAS spectral shapes [1,2]. </p><p>Nanoscale chemical imaging of catalysts under working conditions is possible with transmission x-ray microscopy. We have shown that TXM can image a catalytic system under relevant reaction conditions and provides detailed information on the morphology and composition of the catalyst material in situ [3]. The 20 nanometer resolution combined with powerful chemical speciation by XAS and the ability to image materials under reaction conditions opens up new opportunities to study many chemical processes. I will discuss the present status of in-situ TXM, with an emphasis on the abilities of the 10+ nm resolution TXM technique in comparison with 0.1 nm STEM-EELS [4,5]. Hard X-ray TXM allows the measurement of chemical images and tomographs under more realistic conditions, using a capillary reactor at 10 bar Fischer-Tropsch conditions [6].</p><p>The second part of the talk deals with resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), In 2p3d RIXS one scans through the 2p XAS edge and measures the optical excitation range. As an example, the RIXS spectra of CoO will be discussed. The experimental resolution of 100 meV at ADRESS allows the detailed observation of the electronic structure. First-principle theoretical modelling was performed for the ground state and multiplet analysis for the RIXS experiments. The implications for measurements on coordination compounds (cobalt carboxylates) and cobalt nanoparticles is discussed, in particular the comparison with optical spectroscopy [7]. Related to the RIXS measurements is the analysis of Fluorescence yield (FY) detected x-ray absorption spectra (XAS), including the intrinsic deviations of the FY-XAS spectral shape from the XAS spectrum [8-10]. <br />----------------------------------------------------<br />[1]    Core Level Spectroscopy of Solids <br />Frank de Groot and Akio Kotani (Taylor & Francis CRC press, 2008)<br />[2]    Download the x-ray spectroscopy simulation software at  <a href=""http://www.anorg.chem.uu.nl/CTM4XAS/"">http://www.anorg.chem.uu.nl/CTM4XAS/</a><br />[3]    E. de Smit et al.

In her dissertation she focuses on small female figurines from southern Israel, using these various modes of inquiry to ascertain the function of the figurines and their role in Judean ritual life. Erin is also the co-director of the Ayn Gharandal Archaeological Project in southern Jordan, where she and her husband run an archaeological field school during the summer months. Upcoming projects include further work on figurines from Israel, Jordan, and Syria and the publication of the excavations at En Hatsevah, Israel. When she is not teaching in the States, Erin spends much of her time at archaeological sites in the Middle East, such as Cave 1 at Qumran, where the first Dead Scrolls were found.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/fatal-attraction_erin_darby"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Fatal%20Attraction:%20Obsession,%20Aversion,%20%20and%20the%20Femme%20Fatale%20in%20Ancient%20Judah&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%206,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ADr.%20Erin%20Darby's%20research%20and%20teaching%20interests%20include%20topics%20in%20Biblical%20Studies,%20Ancient%20Near%20Eastern%20Studies,%20Archaeology,%20Anthropology,%20Art%20History,%20Judaic%20Studies,%20Ritual%20Studies,%20and%20Gender%20Studies.%20In%20her%20dissertation%20she%20focuses%20on%20small%20female%20figurines%20from%20southern%20Israel,%20using%20these%20various%20modes%20of%20inquiry%20to%20ascertain%20the%20function%20of%20the%20figurines%20and%20their%20role%20in%20Judean%20ritual%20life.%20Erin%20is%20also%20the%20co-director%20of%20the%20%E2%80%98Ayn%20Gharandal%20Archaeological%20Project%20in%20southern%20Jordan,%20where%20she%20and%20her%20husband%20run%20an%20archaeological%20field%20school%20during%20the%20summer%20months.%20Upcoming%20projects%20include%20further%20work%20on%20figurines%20from%20Israel,%20Jordan,%20and%20Syria%20and%20the%20publication%20of%20the%20excavations%20at%20%E2%80%98En%20Hatsevah,%20Israel.%20When%20she%20is%20not%20teaching%20in%20the%20States,%20Erin%20spends%20much%20of%20her%20time%20at%20archaeological%20sites%20in%20the%20Middle%20East,%20such%20as%20Cave%201%20at%20Qumran,%20where%20the%20first%20Dead%20Scrolls%20were%20found.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/fatal-attraction_erin_darby%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Tue, 06 Oct 2015 04:30:00 -0400","Oct 6, 2015: Fatal Attraction: Obsession, Aversion,  and the Femme Fatale in Ancient Judah at White Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/fatal-attraction_erin_darby","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1514003","-76.485313"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%206,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Tue, 06 Oct 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Oct 6, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486253","-76.486069"

"2015-10-06T12:20:00-04:00","42.448322","<p>Genetically modified (GM) crops can undoubtedly help to feed Africans. The adoption of insect resistant and herbicide tolerant maize by both small-holder and commercial farmers in South Africa has increased both productivity and income. Small-holder farmers are also experiencing a decrease in post-harvest fungal infection in their insect resistant maize. In Burkina Faso and Sudan, planting of insect resistant cotton is steadily increasing as farmers see their profits rising, helping them to feed their families. Unfortunately anti-GM crop sentiment in Europe and elsewhere is sending negative messages to African politicians who are reluctant to approve sorely needed improved crops that their well-fed compatriots to the North are rejecting primarily for trade reasons. It will be a sad indictment on our society if non-scientific reasons prevent Africans access to GM crops.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/genetically_modified_crops_an_african_perspective"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Genetically%20modified%20crops:%20An%20African%20perspective&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%206,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AGenetically%20modified%20(GM)%20crops%20can%20undoubtedly%20help%20to%20feed%20Africans.%20The%20adoption%20of%20insect%20resistant%20and%20herbicide%20tolerant%20maize%20by%20both%20small-holder%20and%20commercial%20farmers%20in%20South%20Africa%20has%20increased%20both%20productivity%20and%20income.%20Small-holder%20farmers%20are%20also%20experiencing%20a%20decrease%20in%20post-harvest%20fungal%20infection%20in%20their%20insect%20resistant%20maize.%20In%20Burkina%20Faso%20and%20Sudan,%20planting%20of%20insect%20resistant%20cotton%20is%20steadily%20increasing%20as%20farmers%20see%20their%20profits%20rising,%20helping%20them%20to%20feed%20their%20families.%20Unfortunately%20anti-GM%20crop%20sentiment%20in%20Europe%20and%20elsewhere%20is%20sending%20negative%20messages%20to%20African%20politicians%20who%20are%20reluctant%20to%20approve%20sorely%20needed%20improved%20crops%20that%20their%20well-fed%20compatriots%20to%20the%20North%20are%20rejecting%20primarily%20for%20trade%20reasons.%20It%20will%20be%20a%20sad%20indictment%20on%20our%20society%20if%20non-scientific%20reasons%20prevent%20Africans%20access%20to%20GM%20crops.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/genetically_modified_crops_an_african_perspective%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Tue, 06 Oct 2015 12:20:00 -0400","Oct 6, 2015: Genetically modified crops: An African perspective at Emerson Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/genetically_modified_crops_an_african_perspective","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1511445","-76.475777"

Professor Greg Fuchs, host.</p><p>Seminar Title: Picosecond Spin Caloritronics</p><p>Abstract: The coupling of spin and heat gives rise to new physical phenomena in nanoscale spin devices and new ways to manipulate local magnetization. This field of study is typically referred to as spin caloritronics. Our work in this field takes advantage of recent advances in the measurement and understanding of heat transport at the nanoscale using ultrafast lasers. We use a picosecond duration pump laser pulses as a source of heat and picosecond duration probe laser pulses to detect changes in temperature, spin accumulation, and spin transfer torque using a combination of time-domain thermoreflectance and time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect Our pump-probe optical methods enable us to change the temperature of ferromagnetic layers on a picosecond time-scale and generate enormous heat fluxes on the order of 100 GW m-2 that persist for ~30 ps. </p><p>Thermally-driven ultrafast demagnetization of a perpendicular ferromagnet leads to spin accumulation in a normal metal and spin transfer torque in an in-plane ferromagnet. The data are well described by models of spin generation and transport based on differences and gradients of thermodynamic parameters. <br />The spin-dependent Seebeck effect of a perpendicular ferromagnetic layer converts a heat current into spin current, which in turn can be used to exert a spin transfer torque (STT) on a second ferromagnetic layer with in-plane magnetization. Using a [Co,Ni] multilayer as the source of spin, an energy fluence of 4 J m-2 creates thermal STT sufficient to induce 1 % tilting of the magnetization of a 2 nm-thick CoFeB layer.</p><p>Poster available.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/lassp_and_aep_seminar_9778"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20LASSP%20and%20A&EP%20SEMINAR&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%206,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ADavid%20Cahill,%20Department%20of%20Materials%20Science%20and%20Engineering,%20UIUC,%20will%20present%20seminar.%20Professor%20Greg%20Fuchs,%20host.%0A%0ASeminar%20Title:%20Picosecond%20Spin%20Caloritronics%0A%0AAbstract:%20The%20coupling%20of%20spin%20and%20heat%20gives%20rise%20to%20new%20physical%20phenomena%20in%20nanoscale%20spin%20devices%20and%20new%20ways%20to%20manipulate%20local%20magnetization.%20This%20field%20of%20study%20is%20typically%20referred%20to%20as%20%E2%80%9Cspin%20caloritronics%E2%80%9D.%20Our%20work%20in%20this%20field%20takes%20advantage%20of%20recent%20advances%20in%20the%20measurement%20and%20understanding%20of%20heat%20transport%20at%20the%20nanoscale%20using%20ultrafast%20lasers.%20We%20use%20a%20picosecond%20duration%20pump%20laser%20pulses%20as%20a%20source%20of%20heat%20and%20picosecond%20duration%20probe%20laser%20pulses%20to%20detect%20changes%20in%20temperature,%20spin%20accumulation,%20and%20spin%20transfer%20torque%20using%20a%20combination%20of%20time-domain%20thermoreflectance%20and%20time-resolved%20magneto-optic%20Kerr%20effect%20Our%20pump-probe%20optical%20methods%20enable%20us%20to%20change%20the%20temperature%20of%20ferromagnetic%20layers%20on%20a%20picosecond%20time-scale%20and%20generate%20enormous%20heat%20fluxes%20on%20the%20order%20of%20100%20GW%20m-2%20that%20persist%20for%20~30%20ps.%20%0A%0AThermally-driven%20ultrafast%20demagnetization%20of%20a%20perpendicular%20ferromagnet%20leads%20to%20spin%20accumulation%20in%20a%20normal%20metal%20and%20spin%20transfer%20torque%20in%20an%20in-plane%20ferromagnet.%20The%20data%20are%20well%20described%20by%20models%20of%20spin%20generation%20and%20transport%20based%20on%20differences%20and%20gradients%20of%20thermodynamic%20parameters.%20%0AThe%20spin-dependent%20Seebeck%20effect%20of%20a%20perpendicular%20ferromagnetic%20layer%20converts%20a%20heat%20current%20into%20spin%20current,%20which%20in%20turn%20can%20be%20used%20to%20exert%20a%20spin%20transfer%20torque%20(STT)%20on%20a%20second%20ferromagnetic%20layer%20with%20in-plane%20magnetization.%20Using%20a%20[Co,Ni]%20multilayer%20as%20the%20source%20of%20spin,%20an%20energy%20fluence%20of%204%20J%20m-2%20creates%20thermal%20STT%20sufficient%20to%20induce%201%20%25%20tilting%20of%20the%20magnetization%20of%20a%202%20nm-thick%20CoFeB%20layer.%0A%0APoster%20available.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/lassp_and_aep_seminar_9778%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Tue, 06 Oct 2015 16:00:00 -0400","Oct 6, 2015: LASSP and A&EP SEMINAR at Clark Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/lassp_and_aep_seminar_9778","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1381592","-76.481209"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%207,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Wed, 07 Oct 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Oct 7, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486254","-76.486069"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%208,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 08 Oct 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Oct 8, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486255","-76.486069"

She interested in theoretical challenges in how we understand how ideologies and power relations are being inscribed in the production and uses of spaces, offline and online, at the local, regional, national, international and transnational level. In investigating these dynamics, Lim is interested in cultural and political implications of the production, consumption and exchange of information in both cyberspace and (physical) urban space. She is fascinated by ongoing creative imaginings of what political action means in the informational society, how power relations are embedded in the production of spaces, and how people continue to create un/civic spaces, institutions and social movements in pursuing their agendas.</p><p>Lim's research projects are inter and trans-diciplinary in nature, cross-cutting several fields such as communications/media studies, urban anthropology, political science, urban planning, urban sociology, geography, science and technology studies (STS), and social computing. Her research is largely qualitative, with ethno-historiography and content analysis as primary methods. In recent years, Lim has also incorporated computational mapping and network analysis into her repertoires. Geographically, Lim's past and current research projects are predominantly conducted in Asian setting (Southeast Asia) and since 2008 have been extended to countries with large Muslim populations such as Middle Eastern and North African countries.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/seap_gatty_lecture_series_895"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20SEAP%20Gatty%20Lecture%20Series&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%208,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0A%22Politics%20Bytes:%20Digital%20Media%20and%20Activism%20in%20Indonesia%22%0A%0AMerlyna%20Lim,%20Canada%20Research%20Chair%20in%20Digital%20Media%20&%20Global%20Network%20Society,%20Carleton%20University%0A%0AMerlyna%20Lim's%20research%20interests%20revolve%20around%20the%20mutual%20shaping%20of%20technology%20and%20society,%20the%20socio-political%20history%20of%20technology,%20and%20the%20politics%20and%20culture%20of%20technology,%20especially%20digital%20media%20and%20information%20and%20communication%20technology%20(ICT),%20in%20relations%20to%20issues%20of%20globalization,%20democratization,%20and%20social%20equity.%20She%20interested%20in%20theoretical%20challenges%20in%20how%20we%20understand%20how%20ideologies%20and%20power%20relations%20are%20being%20inscribed%20in%20the%20production%20and%20uses%20of%20spaces,%20offline%20and%20online,%20at%20the%20local,%20regional,%20national,%20international%20and%20transnational%20level.%20In%20investigating%20these%20dynamics,%20Lim%20is%20interested%20in%20cultural%20and%20political%20implications%20of%20the%20production,%20consumption%20and%20exchange%20of%20information%20in%20both%20cyberspace%20and%20(physical)%20urban%20space.%20She%20is%20fascinated%20by%20ongoing%20creative%20imaginings%20of%20what%20%E2%80%98political%20action%E2%80%99%20means%20in%20the%20informational%20society,%20how%20power%20relations%20are%20embedded%20in%20the%20production%20of%20spaces,%20and%20how%20people%20continue%20to%20create%20un/civic%20spaces,%20institutions%20and%20social%20movements%20in%20pursuing%20their%20agendas.%0A%0ALim's%20research%20projects%20are%20inter%20and%20trans-diciplinary%20in%20nature,%20cross-cutting%20several%20fields%20such%20as%20communications/media%20studies,%20urban%20anthropology,%20political%20science,%20urban%20planning,%20urban%20sociology,%20geography,%20science%20and%20technology%20studies%20(STS),%20and%20social%20computing.%20Her%20research%20is%20largely%20qualitative,%20with%20ethno-historiography%20and%20content%20analysis%20as%20primary%20methods.%20In%20recent%20years,%20Lim%20has%20also%20incorporated%20computational%20mapping%20and%20network%20analysis%20into%20her%20repertoires.%20Geographically,%20Lim's%20past%20and%20current%20research%20projects%20are%20predominantly%20conducted%20in%20Asian%20setting%20(Southeast%20Asia)%20and%20since%202008%20have%20been%20extended%20to%20countries%20with%20large%20Muslim%20populations%20such%20as%20Middle%20Eastern%20and%20North%20African%20countries.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/seap_gatty_lecture_series_895%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 08 Oct 2015 12:00:00 -0400","Oct 8, 2015: SEAP Gatty Lecture Series at Kahin Center",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/seap_gatty_lecture_series_895","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1513846","-76.491318"

"2015-10-08T12:20:00-04:00","42.448322","<p>Understanding of spatio-temporal variations of grain yields and associated edaphic and topographical constraints are important steps for developing precision soil and crop management strategies. In this study, we attempted to increase the spatial resolution of the Yield Gap analysis (<a href=""http://www.yieldgap.org"">www.yieldgap.org</a>) to subfield scales in the context of different soil geographic regions in the Mid-Atlantic US. Twenty six fields with corn, soybeans, and small grain production systems were selected and we combined Baseline Function and spatially-referenced standardized Principal Component Analysis to understand growing season specific in-field yield patterns and to identify edaphic and topographic yield constraints.  In addition, a proximal sensing tool (Veris MSP-3) collected apparent soil electrical conductivity, spectral reflectance, and pH at 18 m interval in each field to increase the spatial resolution of soil information, and tractor-mounted GPS recorded elevation data was used to develop topographic indices.  Overall, this study revealed the importance of region-specific edaphic and topographical variations to explain spatio-temporal yield variations, and that such information can be applied to better manage crop inputs</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/developing_the_data_layers_for_precision_management_of_crop_inputs_using_site-specific_yield_gaps_and_soil_constraints"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Developing%20the%20data%20layers%20for%20precision%20management%20of%20crop%20inputs%20using%20site-specific%20yield%20gaps%20and%20soil%20constraints&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%208,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AUnderstanding%20of%20spatio-temporal%20variations%20of%20grain%20yields%20and%20associated%20edaphic%20and%20topographical%20constraints%20are%20important%20steps%20for%20developing%20precision%20soil%20and%20crop%20management%20strategies.%20In%20this%20study,%20we%20attempted%20to%20increase%20the%20spatial%20resolution%20of%20the%20Yield%20Gap%20analysis%20(www.yieldgap.org)%20to%20subfield%20scales%20in%20the%20context%20of%20different%20soil%20geographic%20regions%20in%20the%20Mid-Atlantic%20US.%20Twenty%20six%20fields%20with%20corn,%20soybeans,%20and%20small%20grain%20production%20systems%20were%20selected%20and%20we%20combined%20Baseline%20Function%20and%20spatially-referenced%20standardized%20Principal%20Component%20Analysis%20to%20understand%20growing%20season%20specific%20in-field%20yield%20patterns%20and%20to%20identify%20edaphic%20and%20topographic%20yield%20constraints.%20%20In%20addition,%20a%20proximal%20sensing%20tool%20(Veris%20MSP-3)%20collected%20apparent%20soil%20electrical%20conductivity,%20spectral%20reflectance,%20and%20pH%20at%2018%20m%20interval%20in%20each%20field%20to%20increase%20the%20spatial%20resolution%20of%20soil%20information,%20and%20tractor-mounted%20GPS%20recorded%20elevation%20data%20was%20used%20to%20develop%20topographic%20indices.%20%20Overall,%20this%20study%20revealed%20the%20importance%20of%20region-specific%20edaphic%20and%20topographical%20variations%20to%20explain%20spatio-temporal%20yield%20variations,%20and%20that%20such%20information%20can%20be%20applied%20to%20better%20manage%20crop%20inputs%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/developing_the_data_layers_for_precision_management_of_crop_inputs_using_site-specific_yield_gaps_and_soil_constraints%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 08 Oct 2015 12:20:00 -0400","Oct 8, 2015: Developing the data layers for precision management of crop inputs using site-specific yield gaps and soil constraints at Emerson Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/developing_the_data_layers_for_precision_management_of_crop_inputs_using_site-specific_yield_gaps_and_soil_constraints","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1553294","-76.475777"

PMP addresses inequities in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods over the summer. Research has found that two-thirds of the ninth-grade achievement gap between lower and higher income youth can be explained by unequal access to summer learning opportunities. Students from low-income areas lose between 2.5 to 3.5 months of academic learning each summer, while their affluent peers are making academic gains.<br />Practice Makes Perfect is a comprehensive summer education program with a proven near-peer model to support students from kindergarten through college matriculation. Our programs pair skills development for younger students with leadership development, career training and college prep for older students. Through a unique multi-relational approach, Practice Makes Perfect strategically matches academically struggling elementary and middle school students with older, higher achieving mentor peers from the same inner-city neighborhoods. Trained college interns and certified teachers supervise the near-peer relationship for a five-week, full-day academic experience.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/addressing_inequality_cornell_alumni_in_action_narrowing_the_achievement_gap_one_summer_at_a_time"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Addressing%20Inequality%20%E2%80%93%20Cornell%20Alumni%20in%20Action:%20Narrowing%20the%20Achievement%20Gap,%20One%20Summer%20at%20a%20Time&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%208,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AVisiting%20Speaker%20and%20Cornell%20Alumnus,%20Karim%20Abouelnaga,%20'13%20is%20the%20CEO%20and%20founder%20of%20the%20non-profit%20organization:%20Practice%20Makes%20Perfect%20(PMP).%20PMP%20addresses%20inequities%20in%20socioeconomically%20disadvantaged%20neighborhoods%20over%20the%20summer.%20Research%20has%20found%20that%20two-thirds%20of%20the%20ninth-grade%20achievement%20gap%20between%20lower%20and%20higher%20income%20youth%20can%20be%20explained%20by%20unequal%20access%20to%20summer%20learning%20opportunities.%20Students%20from%20low-income%20areas%20lose%20between%202.5%20to%203.5%20months%20of%20academic%20learning%20each%20summer,%20while%20their%20affluent%20peers%20are%20making%20academic%20gains.%0APractice%20Makes%20Perfect%20is%20a%20comprehensive%20summer%20education%20program%20with%20a%20proven%20%E2%80%9Cnear-peer%E2%80%9D%20model%20to%20support%20students%20from%20kindergarten%20through%20college%20matriculation.%20Our%20programs%20pair%20skills%20development%20for%20younger%20students%20with%20leadership%20development,%20career%20training%20and%20college%20prep%20for%20older%20students.%20Through%20a%20unique%20multi-relational%20approach,%20Practice%20Makes%20Perfect%20strategically%20matches%20academically%20struggling%20elementary%20and%20middle%20school%20students%20with%20older,%20higher%20achieving%20mentor%20peers%20from%20the%20same%20inner-city%20neighborhoods.%20Trained%20college%20interns%20and%20certified%20teachers%20supervise%20the%20%E2%80%9Cnear-peer%E2%80%9D%20relationship%20for%20a%20five-week,%20full-day%20academic%20experience.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/addressing_inequality_cornell_alumni_in_action_narrowing_the_achievement_gap_one_summer_at_a_time%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 08 Oct 2015 13:25:00 -0400","Oct 8, 2015: Addressing Inequality  Cornell Alumni in Action: Narrowing the Achievement Gap, One Summer at a Time at Uris Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/addressing_inequality_cornell_alumni_in_action_narrowing_the_achievement_gap_one_summer_at_a_time","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1469028","-76.482254"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2011,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Sun, 11 Oct 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Oct 11, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486258","-76.486069"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2013,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Tue, 13 Oct 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Oct 13, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486259","-76.486069"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son.

Besides its biological significance, DNA strand displacement has been utilized as versatile modules and sensors in DNA nanotechnology and computation. As it occurs out of equilibrium, DNA strand displacement may display complex sequence- and salt-dependent kinetics, not easily comprehensible based on DNA base-pair free energies. Quantitative understanding of the underlying kinetics can thus help us design DNA-based reaction schemes and sensors with broad functionality.</p><p>We study kinetics of DNA strand displacement using single-molecule fluorescence experiments which allow straightforward separation of unimolecular and bimolecular reaction steps. In this talk, I will present some interesting effects of DNA mismatch, sequence, and salt concentration on the observed displacement rates and our first passage time model which correctly predicts the observed kinetics. I will also discuss a potential in vivo application we are currently pursuing.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/biophysics_colloquium_3903"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Biophysics%20Colloquium&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2014,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AHarold%20Kim,%20Georgia%20Tech.%0A%0A%22Understanding%20DNA%20strand%20displacement%20at%20the%20base%20pair%20level%22%0A%0AHost:%20Michelle%20Wang%0A%0APoster%20available.%0A%0AAbstract:%20Recombination%20and%20repair%20of%20genetic%20material%20involves%20DNA%20strand%20displacement,%20where%20one%20strand%20of%20duplex%20DNA%20is%20replaced%20with%20another.%20Besides%20its%20biological%20significance,%20DNA%20strand%20displacement%20has%20been%20utilized%20as%20versatile%20modules%20and%20sensors%20in%20DNA%20nanotechnology%20and%20computation.%20As%20it%20occurs%20out%20of%20equilibrium,%20DNA%20strand%20displacement%20may%20display%20complex%20sequence-%20and%20salt-dependent%20kinetics,%20not%20easily%20comprehensible%20based%20on%20DNA%20base-pair%20free%20energies.%20Quantitative%20understanding%20of%20the%20underlying%20kinetics%20can%20thus%20help%20us%20design%20DNA-based%20reaction%20schemes%20and%20sensors%20with%20broad%20functionality.%0A%0AWe%20study%20kinetics%20of%20DNA%20strand%20displacement%20using%20single-molecule%20fluorescence%20experiments%20which%20allow%20straightforward%20separation%20of%20unimolecular%20and%20bimolecular%20reaction%20steps.%20In%20this%20talk,%20I%20will%20present%20some%20interesting%20effects%20of%20DNA%20mismatch,%20sequence,%20and%20salt%20concentration%20on%20the%20observed%20displacement%20rates%20and%20our%20first%20passage%20time%20model%20which%20correctly%20predicts%20the%20observed%20kinetics.%20I%20will%20also%20discuss%20a%20potential%20in%20vivo%20application%20we%20are%20currently%20pursuing.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/biophysics_colloquium_3903%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Wed, 14 Oct 2015 12:00:00 -0400","Oct 14, 2015: Biophysics Colloquium at Clark Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/biophysics_colloquium_3903","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1095203","-76.481209"

Curtis ""Almost a decade before Robert Flaherty immortalized the Inuit people in Nanook of the North (1922), Edward S. Curtis filmed In the Land of the Headhunters with an indigenous North American cast. Like Flaherty's 'documentary,' Headhunters was both a reflection of contemporary life among the Kwakwaka'wakw people of British Columbia as well as a fiction that combined melodramatic elements with tribal customs: Motana, the son of a chief, must battle an old medicine man for the right to marry Naida, who has been promised by her father to the tribe of the headhunters. Around this plot, Curtis stages many authentic ceremonies, including the tribe's potlatch ceremony.""

These magnificent pieces of architecture were once overflowing with plants infused with legend and lore just as wild and exotic as the flowers themselves.  Even these great empires under glass could barely satisfy the insatiable appetite for new and unusual tropical plants including orchids, palms, Aroids and Begonias.  Many of these wonderful plants made only short appearances in cultivation only to survive within the pages of horticultural literature as vestiges of a once glorious period of discovery for glasshouse horticulture.  As time has passed the once remote and virtually inaccessible habitats these plants called home are now reachable and the plants, both those known and some unknown, are within the grasp of horticulture once again. Join Marc Hachadourian of the New York Botanical Garden for a look at modern tropical plant exploration using both traditional and modern tools hunting for spectacular plants that have been long absent from cultivation and their rediscovery and reintroduction to modern glasshouse collections.</p><p> </p><p>As Manager of the Nolen Greenhouses for Living Collections, Hachadourian oversees the state-of-the-art greenhouse complex where tens of thousands of plants are grown for Conservatory exhibitions; the gardens, collections, and seasonal displays; and scientific research. Hachadourian began his career at NYBG as horticulturist for the orchid collection and now serves in a curatorial capacity for that collection. A graduate of Cornell University with a degree in Plant Science, Marc has over 20 years of experience in horticulture, specializing in orchids, tropical and aquatic plants, bulbs, and alpines. He is an active member of many professional societies and has a strong interest in the conservation and cultivation of many groups of plants. Marc oversees the CITES Rescue Center Program for the Garden, helping to take in and rehabilitate plants that have been illegally imported.</p><p>""Modern Plant Exploration in the Tropics"" is the William Hamilton Lecture of Plantations' Fall Lecture Series.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/modern_plant_exploration_in_the_tropics_the_age_of_rediscovery"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Modern%20Plant%20Exploration%20in%20the%20Tropics:%20The%20Age%20of%20Rediscovery&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2014,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0APlant%20exploration%20in%20the%20Tropics%20of%20the%20world%20helped%20drive%20the%20construction%20of%20the%20Great%20Glasshouse%20Conservatories%20of%20Europe%20and%20North%20America.%20These%20magnificent%20pieces%20of%20architecture%20were%20once%20overflowing%20with%20plants%20infused%20with%20legend%20and%20lore%20just%20as%20wild%20and%20exotic%20as%20the%20flowers%20themselves.%20%20Even%20these%20great%20empires%20under%20glass%20could%20barely%20satisfy%20the%20insatiable%20appetite%20for%20new%20and%20unusual%20tropical%20plants%20including%20orchids,%20palms,%20Aroids%20and%20Begonias.%20%20Many%20of%20these%20wonderful%20plants%20made%20only%20short%20appearances%20in%20cultivation%20only%20to%20survive%20within%20the%20pages%20of%20horticultural%20literature%20as%20vestiges%20of%20a%20once%20glorious%20period%20of%20discovery%20for%20glasshouse%20horticulture.%20%20As%20time%20has%20passed%20the%20once%20remote%20and%20virtually%20inaccessible%20habitats%20these%20plants%20called%20home%20are%20now%20reachable%20and%20the%20plants,%20both%20those%20known%20and%20some%20unknown,%20are%20within%20the%20grasp%20of%20horticulture%20once%20again.%20Join%20Marc%20Hachadourian%20of%20the%20New%20York%20Botanical%20Garden%20for%20a%20look%20at%20modern%20tropical%20plant%20exploration%20using%20both%20traditional%20and%20modern%20tools%20hunting%20for%20spectacular%20plants%20that%20have%20been%20long%20absent%20from%20cultivation%20and%20their%20rediscovery%20and%20reintroduction%20to%20modern%20glasshouse%20collections.%0A%0A%20%0A%0AAs%20Manager%20of%20the%20Nolen%20Greenhouses%20for%20Living%20Collections,%20Hachadourian%20oversees%20the%20state-of-the-art%20greenhouse%20complex%20where%20tens%20of%20thousands%20of%20plants%20are%20grown%20for%20Conservatory%20exhibitions;%20the%20gardens,%20collections,%20and%20seasonal%20displays;%20and%20scientific%20research.%20Hachadourian%20began%20his%20career%20at%20NYBG%20as%20horticulturist%20for%20the%20orchid%20collection%20and%20now%20serves%20in%20a%20curatorial%20capacity%20for%20that%20collection.%20A%20graduate%20of%20Cornell%20University%20with%20a%20degree%20in%20Plant%20Science,%20Marc%20has%20over%2020%20years%20of%20experience%20in%20horticulture,%20specializing%20in%20orchids,%20tropical%20and%20aquatic%20plants,%20bulbs,%20and%20alpines.%20He%20is%20an%20active%20member%20of%20many%20professional%20societies%20and%20has%20a%20strong%20interest%20in%20the%20conservation%20and%20cultivation%20of%20many%20groups%20of%20plants.%20Marc%20oversees%20the%20CITES%20Rescue%20Center%20Program%20for%20the%20Garden,%20helping%20to%20take%20in%20and%20rehabilitate%20plants%20that%20have%20been%20illegally%20imported.%0A%0A%22Modern%20Plant%20Exploration%20in%20the%20Tropics%22%20is%20the%20William%20Hamilton%20Lecture%20of%20Plantations'%20Fall%20Lecture%20Series.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/modern_plant_exploration_in_the_tropics_the_age_of_rediscovery%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Wed, 14 Oct 2015 19:30:00 -0400","Oct 14, 2015: Modern Plant Exploration in the Tropics: The Age of Rediscovery at Alice Statler Auditorium",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/modern_plant_exploration_in_the_tropics_the_age_of_rediscovery","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1518715","-76.482132"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

Her research is on the intersection of Buddhist philosophy and practice, especially the ways that Buddhist ideas are interwoven into the psychology of everyday life. The research ties into a broader interest in the role of culture in mental practices and processes and their implications for health and well-being. In this talk Dr. Cassaniti will speak on local Thai interpretations of abstract Buddhist concepts, among them anicchang (impermanence), ploy wang (letting go), kam (karma), and more, and will demonstrate how these localized ideas become implicated in the ways that people in a Northern Thai (muang) community craft emotional experience. Anthropologists have long noted that emotional demeanors at funerals vary across cultures, but they usually explain these differences with terms like cultural display rules or social expression. This talk shows instead how affective practices like smiling at difficulties are understood as part of larger psychological orientations that work to create desired effects. Making use of ethnographic interview data, ritual analysis, and a case study of a local man struggling with alcoholism-induced psychosis in the community Dr. Cassaniti shows how personal experiences are interpreted through particular Buddhist teachings to craft local forms of agency and personal control. Based on her new book, Living Buddhism: Mind, Self and Emotion (Cornell University Press, 2015) the talk informs the study of culture and mind, and the psychology of everyday life in todays Thailand.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/seap_gatty_lecture_series_9305"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20SEAP%20Gatty%20Lecture%20Series&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2015,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0A%22Smiling%20at%20Death:%20Annichang,%20Ploy%20Wang,%20and%20the%20Cultural%20Psychology%20of%20Emotion%20in%20Contemporary%20Thailand%22%0A%0AJulia%20Cassaniti,%20Assistant%20Professor%20Psychological%20and%20Medical%20Anthropology,%20Department%20of%20Anthropology%20Washington%20State%20University%0A%0ADr.%20Cassaniti%20is%20a%20psychological%20and%20medical%20anthropologist%20working%20on%20issues%20of%20contemporary%20religious%20experience%20in%20Southeast%20Asia.%20Her%20research%20is%20on%20the%20intersection%20of%20Buddhist%20philosophy%20and%20practice,%20especially%20the%20ways%20that%20Buddhist%20ideas%20are%20interwoven%20into%20the%20psychology%20of%20everyday%20life.%20The%20research%20ties%20into%20a%20broader%20interest%20in%20the%20role%20of%20culture%20in%20mental%20practices%20and%20processes%20and%20their%20implications%20for%20health%20and%20well-being.%20In%20this%20talk%20Dr.%20Cassaniti%20will%20speak%20on%20local%20Thai%20interpretations%20of%20abstract%20Buddhist%20concepts,%20among%20them%20anicchang%20(impermanence),%20ploy%20wang%20(letting%20go),%20kam%20(karma),%20and%20more,%20and%20will%20demonstrate%20how%20these%20localized%20ideas%20become%20implicated%20in%20the%20ways%20that%20people%20in%20a%20Northern%20Thai%20(muang)%20community%20craft%20emotional%20experience.%20Anthropologists%20have%20long%20noted%20that%20emotional%20demeanors%20at%20funerals%20vary%20across%20cultures,%20but%20they%20usually%20explain%20these%20differences%20with%20terms%20like%20cultural%20%E2%80%98display%20rules%E2%80%99%20or%20%E2%80%98social%20expression%E2%80%99.%20This%20talk%20shows%20instead%20how%20affective%20practices%20like%20smiling%20at%20difficulties%20are%20understood%20as%20part%20of%20larger%20psychological%20orientations%20that%20work%20to%20create%20desired%20effects.%20Making%20use%20of%20ethnographic%20interview%20data,%20ritual%20analysis,%20and%20a%20case%20study%20of%20a%20local%20man%20struggling%20with%20alcoholism-induced%20psychosis%20in%20the%20community%20Dr.%20Cassaniti%20shows%20how%20personal%20experiences%20are%20interpreted%20through%20particular%20Buddhist%20teachings%20to%20craft%20local%20forms%20of%20agency%20and%20personal%20control.%20Based%20on%20her%20new%20book,%20Living%20Buddhism:%20Mind,%20Self%20and%20Emotion%20(Cornell%20University%20Press,%202015)%20the%20talk%20informs%20the%20study%20of%20culture%20and%20mind,%20and%20the%20psychology%20of%20everyday%20life%20in%20today%E2%80%99s%20Thailand.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/seap_gatty_lecture_series_9305%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 15 Oct 2015 12:00:00 -0400","Oct 15, 2015: SEAP Gatty Lecture Series at Kahin Center",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/seap_gatty_lecture_series_9305","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1513851","-76.491318"

"2015-10-15T12:20:00-04:00","42.448322","<p>Heat and drought stress represent two of the most common stresses encountered in modern agricultural production systems causing significant, annual economic loss. In order to address these environmental challenges, the efficient and effective development of high-yielding, stress resilient crop varieties is contingent on the ability to relate genotype to phenotype in the face of changing climatic conditions. To achieve these goals, phenotypic evaluation of physiological relevant traits with application towards applied plant breeding represents the best solution. Through the employment of a novel, field-based, high-throughput phenotyping platform, we evaluated an upland cotton population in order to elucidate the genetic mechanisms responsible for stress adaptive traits by mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL). Using continuous phenotypic data collection also permitted the assessment of QTL patterns across the growing season and revealed the dynamic nature of these QTL. Interestingly, a subset of these identified canopy trait QTL co-localized with those found to control variation for several physiological and agronomic traits, suggesting a shared genetic architecture. Furthermore, QTL for canopy temperature and normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) were in the vicinity of candidate genes associated with response to abiotic stress. This work demonstrates the novel use of a field-based, high-throughput phenotyping system to study the genetic basis of stress-adaptive traits on a time axis in cotton and the results from which have the potential to facilitate the development of stress-resilient cotton cultivars.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/integration_of_highly-dimensional"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Integration%20of%20highly-dimensional%20data%20sets%20for%20the%20development%20of%20stress%20resilient%20crops:%20Connecting%20genotype%20to%20phenotype%20in%20the%20face%20of%20climate%20change%20&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2015,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AHeat%20and%20drought%20stress%20represent%20two%20of%20the%20most%20common%20stresses%20encountered%20in%20modern%20agricultural%20production%20systems%20causing%20significant,%20annual%20economic%20loss.%20In%20order%20to%20address%20these%20environmental%20challenges,%20the%20efficient%20and%20effective%20development%20of%20high-yielding,%20stress%20resilient%20crop%20varieties%20is%20contingent%20on%20the%20ability%20to%20relate%20genotype%20to%20phenotype%20in%20the%20face%20of%20changing%20climatic%20conditions.%20To%20achieve%20these%20goals,%20phenotypic%20evaluation%20of%20physiological%20relevant%20traits%20with%20application%20towards%20applied%20plant%20breeding%20represents%20the%20best%20solution.%20Through%20the%20employment%20of%20a%20novel,%20field-based,%20high-throughput%20phenotyping%20platform,%20we%20evaluated%20an%20upland%20cotton%20population%20in%20order%20to%20elucidate%20the%20genetic%20mechanisms%20responsible%20for%20stress%20adaptive%20traits%20by%20mapping%20quantitative%20trait%20loci%20(QTL).%20Using%20continuous%20phenotypic%20data%20collection%20also%20permitted%20the%20assessment%20of%20QTL%20patterns%20across%20the%20growing%20season%20and%20revealed%20the%20dynamic%20nature%20of%20these%20QTL.%20Interestingly,%20a%20subset%20of%20these%20identified%20canopy%20trait%20QTL%20co-localized%20with%20those%20found%20to%20control%20variation%20for%20several%20physiological%20and%20agronomic%20traits,%20suggesting%20a%20shared%20genetic%20architecture.%20Furthermore,%20QTL%20for%20canopy%20temperature%20and%20normalized%20difference%20vegetative%20index%20(NDVI)%20were%20in%20the%20vicinity%20of%20candidate%20genes%20associated%20with%20response%20to%20abiotic%20stress.%20This%20work%20demonstrates%20the%20novel%20use%20of%20a%20field-based,%20high-throughput%20phenotyping%20system%20to%20study%20the%20genetic%20basis%20of%20stress-adaptive%20traits%20on%20a%20time%20axis%20in%20cotton%20and%20the%20results%20from%20which%20have%20the%20potential%20to%20facilitate%20the%20development%20of%20stress-resilient%20cotton%20cultivars.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/integration_of_highly-dimensional%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 15 Oct 2015 12:20:00 -0400","Oct 15, 2015: Integration of highly-dimensional data sets for the development of stress resilient crops: Connecting genotype to phenotype in the face of climate change  at Emerson Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/integration_of_highly-dimensional","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486666","-76.475777"

It's a paradox. The future can't be simpler than the present and likely not better  just different.This elegiac western is filled with unsentimentalemotion.It's realistic and romantic.The summing up at its end is both cynical and poetic. This last Ford western is rich with life experience, and for all its humor there is an underlying and pervasive sadness that echoes today.Screening and discussion hosted by Vivian Rosenberg Arts '67, Film Instructor at Santa Monica College.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

Debates and teaching in both Art History and Anthropology Departments, in combination with other professional and personal affiliations, consistently reveal the conflicting diversity of ways in which First Nations cultures are understood, by whom and for whom, and how, or whether, contradictory positions are to be reconciled. Such issues prove to be inseparable from broader contemporary methodological, political, ethical and epistemological concerns relating to art.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

"2015-10-17T19:00:00-04:00","42.446495","<p>2015 > Mexico > Directed by Alonso Ruiz Palacios With Tenoch Huerta, Sebastian Aguirre This deadpan comedy is set in late-90s Mexico City during the National University strike, which leaves Sombra and Santos out of school with nothing to do but make up ways to kill time. The abrupt arrival of Sombra's little brother Tomas does little to change their slacker ways until Tomas convinces Sombra to help him track down one of their childhood idols, an unsung Mexican folk-rock singer. Featuring great black and white cinematography, the film was nominated for 12 Mexican Ariel ""Academy Awards"" and won 5, including Best Picture and Best Director. Subtitled.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

The abrupt arrival of Sombra's little brother Tomas does little to change their slacker ways until Tomas convinces Sombra to help him track down one of their childhood idols, an unsung Mexican folk-rock singer.

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

Focusing on a case study from Thailand's Red Shirt movement in 2010-11, this talk engages with the growing scholarly literature on music, sound, and political dissent that addresses this trenchant but (as I will argue) flawed question. I claim that our inquiries into music and dissent are usefully framed by attending to sonic circulation and aurality by way of sound studies.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/seap_gatty_lecture_series_5195"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20SEAP%20Gatty%20Lecture%20Series&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2022,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0A%22Thai%20Red%20Shirt%20Protests%20and%20Radical%20Vernacular%20Protest%20Sound%22%0A%0ABen%20Tausig,%20Assistant%20Professor%20of%20Ethnomusicology,%20Stony%20Brook%20University%0A%0AAs%20a%20global%20financial%20crisis%20rippled%20through%20the%20late%202000s%20and%20early%202010s,%20with%20mass%20protest%20movements%20rising%20in%20its%20wake,%20many%20observers%20asked%20a%20nervous%20question%20of%20keen%20ethnomusicological%20interest:%20where%20are%20the%20protest%20songs?%20Focusing%20on%20a%20case%20study%20from%20Thailand's%20Red%20Shirt%20movement%20in%202010-11,%20this%20talk%20engages%20with%20the%20growing%20scholarly%20literature%20on%20music,%20sound,%20and%20political%20dissent%20that%20addresses%20this%20trenchant%20but%20(as%20I%20will%20argue)%20flawed%20question.%20I%20claim%20that%20our%20inquiries%20into%20music%20and%20dissent%20are%20usefully%20framed%20by%20attending%20to%20sonic%20circulation%20and%20aurality%20by%20way%20of%20sound%20studies.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/seap_gatty_lecture_series_5195%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 22 Oct 2015 12:00:00 -0400","Oct 22, 2015: SEAP Gatty Lecture Series at Kahin Center",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/seap_gatty_lecture_series_5195","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1513853","-76.491318"

Her recent book, Paying for the Party, (co-authored with Elizabeth A. Armstrong) is an indispensable contribution to the dialogue assessing the state of American higher education. A powerful expos of unmet obligations and misplaced priorities, it explains in vivid detail why so many leave college with so little to show for it. Mapping different pathways available to University students, the authors demonstrate that the most well-resourced and seductive route is a party pathway anchored in the Greek system and facilitated by the administration. This pathway exerts influence over the academic and social experiences of all students, and while it benefits the affluent and well-connected, Armstrong and Hamilton make clear how it seriously disadvantages the majority.</p><p>Winner of the ASA 2015 Distinguished Scholar Book Award</p><p>Meets as part of Controversies about Inequality.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/paying_for_the_party_how_college_maintains_inequality"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Paying%20for%20the%20Party:%20How%20College%20Maintains%20Inequality&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2022,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AVisiting%20Speaker,%20Laura%20T.%20Hamilton%20is%20an%20Associate%20Professor%20of%20Sociology%20at%20the%20University%20of%20California-Merced.%20Her%20recent%20book,%20Paying%20for%20the%20Party,%20(co-authored%20with%20Elizabeth%20A.%20Armstrong)%20is%20an%20indispensable%20contribution%20to%20the%20dialogue%20assessing%20the%20state%20of%20American%20higher%20education.%20A%20powerful%20expos%C3%A9%20of%20unmet%20obligations%20and%20misplaced%20priorities,%20it%20explains%20in%20vivid%20detail%20why%20so%20many%20leave%20college%20with%20so%20little%20to%20show%20for%20it.%20Mapping%20different%20pathways%20available%20to%20University%20students,%20the%20authors%20demonstrate%20that%20the%20most%20well-resourced%20and%20seductive%20route%20is%20a%20%E2%80%9Cparty%20pathway%E2%80%9D%20anchored%20in%20the%20Greek%20system%20and%20facilitated%20by%20the%20administration.%20This%20pathway%20exerts%20influence%20over%20the%20academic%20and%20social%20experiences%20of%20all%20students,%20and%20while%20it%20benefits%20the%20affluent%20and%20well-connected,%20Armstrong%20and%20Hamilton%20make%20clear%20how%20it%20seriously%20disadvantages%20the%20majority.%0A%0AWinner%20of%20the%20ASA%202015%20Distinguished%20Scholar%20Book%20Award%0A%0AMeets%20as%20part%20of%20Controversies%20about%20Inequality.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/paying_for_the_party_how_college_maintains_inequality%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 22 Oct 2015 13:25:00 -0400","Oct 22, 2015: Paying for the Party: How College Maintains Inequality at Uris Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/paying_for_the_party_how_college_maintains_inequality","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1469141","-76.482254"
"2015-10-22T14:30:00-04:00","42.447296","<p>Carl LeVan focuses on comparative political institutions, democratization, and African security.  His book, Dictators and Democracy in African Development: The Political Economy of Good Governance in Nigeria (Cambridge University Press, 2015) explains two categories of public policy performance over fifty years, challenging conventional explanations that blame ethnicity, oil, foreign debt, and other factors. He has also published influential critiques of power sharing in Africa and on the Department of Defense's U.S. Africa Command. His 2011 essay ""Questioning Tocqueville in Africa"" won the Frank Cass Prize for Best Article by a Young Scholar from Routledge/Taylor & Francis Publishing. Other recent research examines the economic consequences of coalition governments in Africa, and property rights and migration in Abuja, Nigeria. A collaborative project with SPA Professor Todd Eisenstadt examines the political impacts of participatory constitution-making. A collection of essays forthcoming in 2015 (with Joseph Fashagba and Edward McMahon) examines African state-level legislative politics.

"2015-10-22T16:00:00-04:00","42.448891","<p>Many rocky exoplanets around red dwarf stars are likely to be tidally locked, with permanent day and night sides. In such cases, condensation of the atmosphere on the planet's night side can occur if the cross-hemispheric energy transport is sufficiently weak. Understanding when and why this happens is a fundamental challenge for theorists because atmospheric collapse will affect phase curve interpretation, exoplanet habitability, and many other issues. Here I discuss new work on this problem using a hierarchical approach. I show that over a wide range of parameters the atmospheric boundary layer, rather than the large-scale circulation, is the key to understanding the planetary energy balance. I present a scaling analysis that predicts the day-night temperature difference using only external parameters. I then compare these results to a range of cases studied using a full 3D climate model with realistic band-resolved radiative transfer, and discuss the implications for observables and for habitability.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/atmospheric_circulation_and_collapse_on_tidally_locked_exoplanets"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20%20Atmospheric%20circulation%20and%20collapse%20on%20tidally%20locked%20exoplanets&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2022,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AMany%20rocky%20exoplanets%20around%20red%20dwarf%20stars%20are%20likely%20to%20be%20tidally%20locked,%20with%20permanent%20day%20and%20night%20sides.%20In%20such%20cases,%20condensation%20of%20the%20atmosphere%20on%20the%20planet's%20night%20side%20can%20occur%20if%20the%20cross-hemispheric%20energy%20transport%20is%20sufficiently%20weak.%20Understanding%20when%20and%20why%20this%20happens%20is%20a%20fundamental%20challenge%20for%20theorists%20because%20atmospheric%20collapse%20will%20affect%20phase%20curve%20interpretation,%20exoplanet%20habitability,%20and%20many%20other%20issues.%20Here%20I%20discuss%20new%20work%20on%20this%20problem%20using%20a%20hierarchical%20approach.%20I%20show%20that%20over%20a%20wide%20range%20of%20parameters%20the%20atmospheric%20boundary%20layer,%20rather%20than%20the%20large-scale%20circulation,%20is%20the%20key%20to%20understanding%20the%20planetary%20energy%20balance.%20I%20present%20a%20scaling%20analysis%20that%20predicts%20the%20day-night%20temperature%20difference%20using%20only%20external%20parameters.%20I%20then%20compare%20these%20results%20to%20a%20range%20of%20cases%20studied%20using%20a%20full%203D%20climate%20model%20with%20realistic%20band-resolved%20radiative%20transfer,%20and%20discuss%20the%20implications%20for%20observables%20and%20for%20habitability.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/atmospheric_circulation_and_collapse_on_tidally_locked_exoplanets%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 22 Oct 2015 16:00:00 -0400","Oct 22, 2015:  Atmospheric circulation and collapse on tidally locked exoplanets at Space Sciences Building",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/atmospheric_circulation_and_collapse_on_tidally_locked_exoplanets","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1502807","-76.48114"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2023,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Fri, 23 Oct 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Oct 23, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486268","-76.486069"

In a space configured to evoke an interrogation room, visitors will find a display of four objects that once belonged to Huangs father and that trigger childhood memories of the artists past, resonating in the present through his own relationship with his young son. Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

We will dine in the sleek community room in Deborah's Playa Vista apartment complex while watching the riveting 1973 drama Dont Look Now .Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie mesmerize as a married couple on an extended trip to Venice following a family tragedy. While in that elegantly decaying city, they have a series of inexplicable, terrifying and increasingly dangerous experiences. A masterpiece from Nicolas Roeg, Dont Look Now , adapted from a story by Daphne du Maurier, is a brilliantly disturbing tale of the supernatural, as renowned for its innovative editing and haunting cinematography as its naturalistic eroticism and unforgettable climax and denouement, one of the great endings in horror history.Leading the post-viewing discussion will be Karen Stetler '83, who works for The Criterion Collection, a company that packages hundreds of classic movies for film buffs. For Dont Look Now she worked on interviews dealing with the making of the film and produced a new piece, a conversation between the film's editor Graeme Clifford (director of Francis , 1982) and Bobbie O'Steen, a film writer and historian.Karen has also worked on the original ""Director Approved"" laserdisc release of Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull as well as ""director approved"" editions of Robert Altman's Short Cuts , David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers , Terry Gilliam's Brazil, Roman Polanski's Knife in the Water</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/cornell_club_of_los_angeles_-_dinner_movie_and_discussion"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Cornell%20Club%20of%20Los%20Angeles%20-%20Dinner,%20Movie%20and%20Discussion&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2024,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ADinner,%20Movie%20and%20Discussion%20in%20Playa%20VistaScholarship%20Fundraising%20Event!Date:%20Saturday,%20October%2024,%206:30%20pmHost:%20Deborah%20Arrindell%20'79Donation:%20$60%20per%20person%20or%20$100%20per%20coupleLimit:%2025%20guestsCornellians%20have%20always%20loved%20the%20movies.Enjoy%20fresh%20Maine%20lobster%20on%20a%20yummy%20split%20bun%20with%20either%20butter%20or%20seasoned%20mayo%20and%20other%20delicious%20sides%20while%20experiencing%20Maine%20Root%20handcrafted%20beverages.%20We%20will%20dine%20in%20the%20sleek%20community%20room%20in%20Deborah's%20Playa%20Vista%20apartment%20complex%20while%20watching%20the%20riveting%201973%20drama%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Look%20Now%20.Donald%20Sutherland%20and%20Julie%20Christie%20mesmerize%20as%20a%20married%20couple%20on%20an%20extended%20trip%20to%20Venice%20following%20a%20family%20tragedy.%20While%20in%20that%20elegantly%20decaying%20city,%20they%20have%20a%20series%20of%20inexplicable,%20terrifying%20and%20increasingly%20dangerous%20experiences.%20A%20masterpiece%20from%20Nicolas%20Roeg,%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Look%20Now%20,%20adapted%20from%20a%20story%20by%20Daphne%20du%20Maurier,%20is%20a%20brilliantly%20disturbing%20tale%20of%20the%20supernatural,%20as%20renowned%20for%20its%20innovative%20editing%20and%20haunting%20cinematography%20as%20its%20naturalistic%20eroticism%20and%20unforgettable%20climax%20and%20denouement,%20one%20of%20the%20great%20endings%20in%20horror%20history.Leading%20the%20post-viewing%20discussion%20will%20be%20Karen%20Stetler%20'83,%20who%20works%20for%20The%20Criterion%20Collection,%20a%20company%20that%20packages%20hundreds%20of%20classic%20movies%20for%20film%20buffs.%20For%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Look%20Now%20she%20worked%20on%20interviews%20dealing%20with%20the%20making%20of%20the%20film%20and%20produced%20a%20new%20piece,%20a%20conversation%20between%20the%20film's%20editor%20Graeme%20Clifford%20(director%20of%20Francis%20,%201982)%20and%20Bobbie%20O'Steen,%20a%20film%20writer%20and%20historian.Karen%20has%20also%20worked%20on%20the%20original%20%22Director%20Approved%22%20laserdisc%20release%20of%20Martin%20Scorsese's%20Raging%20Bull%20as%20well%20as%20%22director%20approved%22%20editions%20of%20Robert%20Altman's%20Short%20Cuts%20,%20David%20Cronenberg's%20Dead%20Ringers%20,%20Terry%20Gilliam's%20Brazil,%20Roman%20Polanski's%20Knife%20in%20the%20Water%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/cornell_club_of_los_angeles_-_dinner_movie_and_discussion%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Sat, 24 Oct 2015 18:30:00 -0400","Oct 24, 2015: Cornell Club of Los Angeles - Dinner, Movie and Discussion at Playa Vista, CA",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/cornell_club_of_los_angeles_-_dinner_movie_and_discussion","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1484654","-118.427578"

When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2025,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Sun, 25 Oct 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Oct 25, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486270","-76.486069"

His other passion is Tintin, the Belgian comic character brought to life by Steven Spielberg.

Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

"2015-10-27T12:20:00-04:00","42.448322","<p>Five of the global issues most frequently debated today are the decline of biodiversity in general and of agrobiodiversity in particular, climate change, hunger and malnutrition, poverty and water. The five issues are connected with each other, and as such, they should be dealt with. In this paper we show how seed is central to all five issues. Most of our food comes from seeds (even when we eat meat, we indirectly eat plants, which are coming from seeds) and food affects our health. Therefore, talking about seeds means talking about our health. The way in which seed is produced has been the cause and can be the solution to all five issues. The evolution of plant breeding, the science which is responsible for the type and the diversity of seed that farmers plant, and hence for the diversity of food that we eat, helps understanding how agrobiodiversity decreased. GMOs can only be a short term and unstable solution to food security because they change the environment surrounding the organisms they intend to control, so that, as predicted by the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection they evolve resistance. An agro ecological model of agriculture could be solution to the most important problems affecting the planet, but is often criticized for not being able to produce enough food for a growing population casting doubts on whether food security and food safety can be compatible objectives. Participatory and evolutionary plant breeding, while benefiting from advances in molecular genetics, reconcile increased production of more readily available and accessible food, with increased agrobiodiversity while maintaining the evolutionary potential of our crops needed to cope with climate change. Being based on selection for specific adaptation, participatory and evolutionary plant breeding are able to produce varieties specifically adapted to an agro ecological agricultural model which can reconcile food safety with food security.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/seeds_of_the_future"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Seeds%20of%20the%20future&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2027,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0AFive%20of%20the%20global%20issues%20most%20frequently%20debated%20today%20are%20the%20decline%20of%20biodiversity%20in%20general%20and%20of%20agrobiodiversity%20in%20particular,%20climate%20change,%20hunger%20and%20malnutrition,%20poverty%20and%20water.%20The%20five%20issues%20are%20connected%20with%20each%20other,%20and%20as%20such,%20they%20should%20be%20dealt%20with.%20In%20this%20paper%20we%20show%20how%20seed%20is%20central%20to%20all%20five%20issues.%20Most%20of%20our%20food%20comes%20from%20seeds%20(even%20when%20we%20eat%20meat,%20we%20indirectly%20eat%20plants,%20which%20are%20coming%20from%20seeds)%20and%20food%20affects%20our%20health.%20Therefore,%20talking%20about%20seeds%20means%20talking%20about%20our%20health.%20The%20way%20in%20which%20seed%20is%20produced%20has%20been%20the%20cause%20and%20can%20be%20the%20solution%20to%20all%20five%20issues.%20The%20evolution%20of%20plant%20breeding,%20the%20science%20which%20is%20responsible%20for%20the%20type%20and%20the%20diversity%20of%20seed%20that%20farmers%20plant,%20and%20hence%20for%20the%20diversity%20of%20food%20that%20we%20eat,%20helps%20understanding%20how%20agrobiodiversity%20decreased.%20GMOs%20can%20only%20be%20a%20short%20term%20and%20unstable%20solution%20to%20food%20security%20because%20they%20change%20the%20environment%20surrounding%20the%20organisms%20they%20intend%20to%20control,%20so%20that,%20as%20predicted%20by%20the%20Fundamental%20Theorem%20of%20Natural%20Selection%20they%20evolve%20resistance.%20An%20agro%20ecological%20model%20of%20agriculture%20could%20be%20solution%20to%20the%20most%20important%20problems%20affecting%20the%20planet,%20but%20is%20often%20criticized%20for%20not%20being%20able%20to%20produce%20enough%20food%20for%20a%20growing%20population%20casting%20doubts%20on%20whether%20food%20security%20and%20food%20safety%20can%20be%20compatible%20objectives.%20Participatory%20and%20evolutionary%20plant%20breeding,%20while%20benefiting%20from%20advances%20in%20molecular%20genetics,%20reconcile%20increased%20production%20of%20more%20readily%20available%20and%20accessible%20food,%20with%20increased%20agrobiodiversity%20while%20maintaining%20the%20evolutionary%20potential%20of%20our%20crops%20needed%20to%20cope%20with%20climate%20change.%20Being%20based%20on%20selection%20for%20specific%20adaptation,%20participatory%20and%20evolutionary%20plant%20breeding%20are%20able%20to%20produce%20varieties%20specifically%20adapted%20to%20an%20agro%20ecological%20agricultural%20model%20which%20can%20reconcile%20food%20safety%20with%20food%20security.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/seeds_of_the_future%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Tue, 27 Oct 2015 12:20:00 -0400","Oct 27, 2015: Seeds of the future at Emerson Hall",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/seeds_of_the_future","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1532331","-76.475777"

Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator.

Through these rather mundane objects and seemingly innocuous experiences Huang explores the cross-generational perspective and deep emotional impact of simultaneously being both father and son.</p><p>Visitors are invited to investigate the objects and their history from the vantage point of an interrogator. When wearing 3-D glasses, one can see the objects organically evolve in surprising ways that hover between reality and the virtual, decay and rebirth, memory and imagination.</p><p><a href=""http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance"">View on site</a> | <a href=""mailto:?subject=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event:%20Huang%20Hsin-chien:%20The%20Inheritance&amp;body=I%20found%20an%20interesting%20event%20you%20may%20like:%0A%0A%0ADate:%20Oct%2029,%202015%0A%0ADescription:%0ATaiwanese%20artist%20Huang%20Hsin-chien%E2%80%99s%20installation%20combines%20everyday%20objects%20with%20real-time%20video%20and%20virtual%20stereoscopic%20computer-generated%20animation%20to%20explore%20memory,%20dreams,%20and%20what%20lies%20beneath%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20In%20a%20space%20configured%20to%20evoke%20an%20interrogation%20room,%20visitors%20will%20find%20a%20display%20of%20four%20objects%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20Huang%E2%80%99s%20father%20and%20that%20trigger%20childhood%20memories%20of%20the%20artist%E2%80%99s%20past,%20resonating%20in%20the%20present%20through%20his%20own%20relationship%20with%20his%20young%20son.%20Through%20these%20rather%20mundane%20objects%20and%20seemingly%20innocuous%20experiences%20Huang%20explores%20the%20cross-generational%20perspective%20and%20deep%20emotional%20impact%20of%20simultaneously%20being%20both%20father%20and%20son.%0A%0AVisitors%20are%20invited%20to%20investigate%20the%20objects%20and%20their%20history%20from%20the%20vantage%20point%20of%20an%20interrogator.%20When%20wearing%203-D%20glasses,%20one%20can%20see%20the%20objects%20organically%20evolve%20in%20surprising%20ways%20that%20hover%20between%20reality%20and%20the%20virtual,%20decay%20and%20rebirth,%20memory%20and%20imagination.%0A%0Ahttp://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance%0A"">Email this event</a></a></p>","Thu, 29 Oct 2015 10:00:00 -0400","Oct 29, 2015: Huang Hsin-chien: The Inheritance at Johnson Museum of Art",None,"http://events.cornell.edu/event/huang_hsin-chien_the_inheritance","tag:localist.com,2008:EventInstance_1486273","-76.486069"
